The worldwide prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(T2DM) in adults has increased from ~150 million 
affected people in 2000 to >450 million in 2019 and is 
projected to rise further to ~700 million by 2045 (ref.1). 
Genetics and lifestyle habits (such as consumption of 
a high-​sugar diet and a sedentary lifestyle) can have a 
predisposing influence as T2DM occurs at varying rates 
in people of different racial and/or ethnic backgrounds2. 
In addition, the level of adiposity can affect the risk of 
T2DM. For example, the prevalence of T2DM increases 
proportionally with increasing BMI; however, the dis-
ease can occur even among those with body weight in 
the normal range2. The excess accumulation of adipose 
tissue in the body negatively affects nearly all physiolog-
ical functions and organ systems, and increases the risk 
of cardiometabolic disease3. Large prospective studies 
have demonstrated that an increase in body weight over 
time considerably increases the incidence of T2DM4 
(Fig. 1). Likewise, an increase in BMI of 5 kg/m2, from 
the upper limit of normal BMI (25 kg/m2) to the lower 
limit of obesity (30 kg/m2), more than doubles the 
risk of death associated with T2DM5. Evidence clearly 
indicates, however, that the risk of T2DM increases 
with increasing BMI well before clinical obesity is 
diagnosed6–8.
The mechanisms responsible for the tight link 
between weight gain and the development of prediabetes 
and T2DM are not completely clear; however, excessive 
accumulation of fat in the body increases insulin resist-
ance and brings about other subtle metabolic changes, 
well before T2DM is diagnosed9. For example, obesity 
is associated with increased fatty acid release into the 
circulation10, decreased insulin sensitivity in muscle, 
liver and adipose tissue11, and excessive fat accumula-
tion in adipose tissue and liver12, as well as potentially in 
other organs (for example, pancreas and skeletal mus-
cle)13; these metabolic alterations can occur even before 
abnormalities in glucose homeostasis manifest. Early 
in the natural history of T2DM, metabolic alterations 
that are associated with fat accumulation are accom-
panied by gradual and only minor increases in fasting 
and postprandial hyperglycaemia (that is, prediabetes), 
owing to a compensatory increase in pancreatic insu-
lin secretion (hyperinsulinaemia) that helps mask the 
effects of insulin resistance and maintains normal gly-
caemic control14,15 (Fig. 2). Eventually, however, β-​cells 
begin to fail and insulin secretion can no longer keep up 
with the increased demand for insulin; therefore, fast-
ing and postprandial glucose concentrations rise further 
and the diagnosis of T2DM ensues14,15 (Fig. 2). The close

Abstract | Evidence from observational studies and randomized trials suggests that prediabetes and 
type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) can develop in genetically susceptible individuals in parallel with 
weight (that is, fat) gain. Accordingly, studies show that weight loss can produce remission of T2DM 
in a dose-​dependent manner. A weight loss of ~15 kg, achieved by calorie restriction as part of an 
intensive management programme, can lead to remission of T2DM in ~80% of patients with obesity 
and T2DM. However, long-​term weight loss maintenance is challenging. Obesity and T2DM are 
associated with diminished glucose uptake in the brain that impairs the satiating effect of dietary 
carbohydrate; therefore, carbohydrate restriction might help maintain weight loss and maximize 
metabolic benefits. Likewise, increases in physical activity and fitness are an important contributor 
to T2DM remission when combined with calorie restriction and weight loss. Preliminary studies 
suggest that a precision dietary management approach that uses pretreatment glycaemic status  
to stratify patients can help optimize dietary recommendations with respect to carbohydrate, fat 
and dietary fibre. This approach might lead to improved weight loss maintenance and glycaemic 
control. Future research should focus on better understanding the individual response to dietary 
treatment and translating these findings into clinical practice.

relationship between increasing body fatness and T2DM 
has led to the connotation ‘diabesity’, which highlights 
the fact that many individuals with T2DM also have 
overweight or obesity and also highlights the need for 
combined treatment strategies16,17.
In this Review, we highlight large randomized clin-
ical trials that provide evidence of T2DM remission 
after weight loss induced by intensive diet-​based life-
style programmes, alongside findings from smaller, 
well-​controlled and mechanistic studies. We consider the 
role of macronutrient composition of the diet, including 
carbohydrate quality and/or restriction. We also discuss 
results showing that physical activity can contribute to 
T2DM remission when combined with diet-​induced 
weight loss. Finally, we cover preliminary findings that 
suggest that individuals with prediabetes can be stratified 
according to metabolic status to optimize recommenda-
tions of dietary composition for long-​term weight loss 
maintenance and thereby prevent progression to T2DM.
Weight control for T2DM treatment
Studies have repeatedly shown the importance of 
body weight control for the management of T2DM16. 
Data from the Swedish Obese Subjects study18 and the 
Scandinavian Obesity Surgery registry19 demonstrate 
that major weight loss 2 years after bariatric surgery is 
accompanied by complete remission of T2DM in 72% 
and 58% of patients with T2DM, respectively. Likewise, 
patients with T2DM who are treated with glucagon-​like 
peptide 1 (GLP1) analogues have associated weight loss, 
which is accompanied by sixfold to tenfold greater odds 
for T2DM remission (defined as HbA1c ≤6.5%) than with 
placebo20. However, both bariatric surgery and medica-
tions can have important weight loss-​independent effects 
on glucose metabolism. For example, GLP1 analogues 
stimulate insulin secretion and perhaps also increase 
insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues21,22. Furthermore, 
postprandial levels of GLP1 and other incretins are 
substantially increased by certain bariatric surgery 
procedures (for example, gastric bypass and sleeve gas-
trectomy)21. Therefore, the aforementioned findings do 
not allow researchers to distinguish between the effects 
of weight loss per se and weight loss-​independent 
mechanisms on T2DM remission.
Proof of concept. Weight loss induced solely by dietary 
calorie restriction dose-​dependently improves body 
composition by progressively decreasing total body fat, 
intra-​abdominal fat (known as visceral adipose tissue) 
and intrahepatic lipid content23. Moderate diet-​induced 
weight loss (~5% of baseline body weight) in non-​
diabetic individuals with obesity and metabolic dys-
function decreases fasting blood glucose and insulin 
concentrations, increases insulin sensitivity in the liver, 
adipose tissue and muscle, and improves β-​cell function. 
Additional weight loss (11–16% of baseline body weight) 
further improves muscle insulin sensitivity and β-​cell 
function23. Accordingly, progressively greater weight loss 
(from no change to >14% loss of baseline body weight) 
in patients with obesity and T2DM is associated with 
progressively increasing reductions in fasting glucose, 
insulin and HbA1c concentrations; that is, stepwise 
improvements in glycaemic control24.
Mechanistic studies showed that diet-​induced weight 
loss (6–17 kg) in patients with obesity and T2DM 
decreased fasting glucose concentrations predominantly 
owing to augmented suppression of basal hepatic glu-
cose production (that is, improved hepatic insulin sen-
sitivity)25,26. Furthermore, the decrease in postprandial 
glucose concentrations occurred predominantly due 
to augmented stimulation of peripheral glucose uptake 
(that is, improved muscle insulin sensitivity)25. Several 
small but well-​controlled studies in patients with obesity 
and T2DM have demonstrated that considerable weight 
loss (>15 kg or ~15% of baseline body weight) induced 
by calorie restriction over a fairly short period of time 
(1.5–6 months) brings about substantial reductions of 
fasting blood glucose and HbA1c levels for most patients, 
which can lead to the normalization of these parameters 
in some patients27–29.
In one such mechanistic study of 11 patients with 
overweight or obesity with short-​duration T2DM 
(<4 years), a weight loss of ~15.3 kg (~15% of baseline 
weight) achieved over 8 weeks by a very-​low-​calorie diet 
was associated with decreased fat content in the liver 
and pancreas as well as increased first-​phase insulin 
Key points
• Studies show that weight loss can produce remission of type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(T2DM) in a dose-​dependent manner.
• In patients with T2DM and obesity, weight loss of ~15 kg, achieved by an intensive 
management programme involving calorie restriction, can lead to remission of  
T2DM in ~80% of individuals.
• Long-​term maintenance of weight loss and metabolic health in people who have 
undergone intensive lifestyle intervention is challenging.
• Carbohydrate restriction might help maintain weight loss and maximize metabolic 
benefits.
• When combined with calorie restriction and weight loss, increases in physical activity 
and fitness are an important contributor to T2DM remission.
• Preliminary work suggests that pretreatment glycaemic status could be used to 
stratify patients in order to optimize dietary recommendations.

secretion, and led to remission of T2DM in all patients30. 
These results were striking because of the demonstration 
that weight loss can restore first-​phase insulin secretion 
in patients with T2DM; this effect is probably an integral 
mechanism for remission. This hypothesis was supported 
by the results of several subsequent trials that assessed 
the effects of weight loss on T2DM remission after die-
tary interventions ranging in duration from 5 months to 
2 years. These studies found that patients who responded 
to treatment were characterized by shorter T2DM dura-
tion and an increase in first-​phase insulin secretion 
after weight loss, which did not occur in patients who 
did not respond to treatment despite similar weight 
loss31,32. Likewise, reductions in pancreatic fat, liver fat 
and hepatic very-​low-​density lipoprotein (VLDL) tri-
glyceride secretion rate were more pronounced among 
the patients who responded to treatment than in patients 
who did not respond to treatment31,32.
Interestingly, one study also reported on the charac-
teristics of those who achieved remission at 5 months into 
the weight loss intervention but subsequently relapsed 
to redevelop T2DM at 2 years of follow-​up32. Compared 
with individuals with durable remission, patients 
who relapsed regained more weight from 5 months 
to 2 years of follow-​up and showed substantial rebounds 
in the fat content of the pancreas and liver, hepatic VLDL 
triglyceride secretion rate and increases in VLDL trig­
lyceride palmitate content, as well as a complete return 
to baseline in first-​phase insulin secretion32. Therefore, 
an increased ability of the pancreas to secrete insu-
lin and the restoration of first-​phase insulin secretion 
— in other words, the capacity to recover β-​cell 
function — has emerged as a key factor for T2DM 
remission after weight loss.
It is less clear from the results of these studies30–32 
whether β-​cell recovery in patients who respond to 
treatment depends in a causal manner to the decrease in 
ectopic fat accumulation in these individuals; similarly 
it remains unknown whether the rebound in ectopic fat 
content in patients who relapsed is the cause of β-​cell 
function returning to baseline. The β-​cells may well have 
a threshold for lipid-​related insults and stress from vari-
ous sources (for example, excess liver fat and augmented 
VLDL triglyceride secretion, more circulating free fatty 
acids and excess pancreatic fat) that renders them less 
responsive to weight loss, particularly with regard to 
longer-​duration T2DM33. The coordinated changes in 
VLDL triglyceride palmitate content that accompany 
T2DM remission and relapse in patients who under-
went diet-​induced weight loss highlight a possible causal 
link, as palmitic acid (the primary product of hepatic 
de novo lipogenesis) is particularly cytotoxic against 
β-​cells in vitro32. These observations support the view 
that the optimal time to intervene for reversing T2DM 
is at the time of diagnosis34. Nonetheless, a low-​calorie 
intervention with total diet replacement can lead to 
substantial reductions in body weight and considerable 
improvements in glycaemic control, and thus diminish 
insulin burden, even among patients with long-​standing 
T2DM who are treated with insulin35.
Evidence from large randomized clinical trials. A few 
large randomized controlled trials have reported on the 
relationship between weight loss achieved by lifestyle 
modification and remission of T2DM. For example, in 
the Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) study, 
a multi-​centre trial conducted in the USA, participants 
were randomized to intensive lifestyle intervention,

2-​h blood glucose (2h-​Glucose) concentrations (obtained from an oral glucose tolerance test) and homoeostasis model

range based on fasting glucose (6.1–7.0 mmol/l) and 2-​h glucose (7.8–11.1 mmol/l) concentrations, respectively. 
Accordingly, fasting glucose levels above the light blue band and 2-​h glucose levels above the dark blue band are  
indicative of T2DM. Data originally presented in ref.14.

which focused on the adoption of an energy-​prudent 
diet (1200–1800 kcal per day) and a physically active life-
style (175 min of moderate-​intensity physical activity per 
week) or a control group36. Participants in the lifestyle 
intervention group lost significantly more weight during 
the first 4 years than participants randomized to the con-
trol group (8.6% versus 0.7%, respectively, at year 1; and 
4.7% versus 0.8%, respectively, at year 4; both P < 0.001), 
and had greater increases in fitness, as well as a 6.6-​fold 
greater prevalence of T2DM remission (partial or com-
plete, defined respectively as the transition from meeting 
T2DM criteria to the prediabetes level of glycaemia or 
to the full normalization of glycaemia, without T2DM 
medication)36. However, absolute remission rates were 
low (11.5% at year 1 and 7.3% at year 4 in the inter-
vention group), which is probably owing to the modest 
amount of weight loss achieved and the wide range of 
T2DM duration at baseline (median of 5 years with an 
interquartile range of 8 years)36, or even the composi-
tion of the prescribed diet37. Although participants in the 
intensive lifestyle intervention group reduced their calo-
rie intake, this was achieved predominantly by restricting 
consumption of dietary fat rather than carbohydrate; as a 
result, the percentage of energy obtained from carbohy-
drate increased38, which might have limited the efficacy 
of the diet (see below). Remission of T2DM at any time 
during follow-​up was more likely for individuals with a 
shorter duration of T2DM (<2 years), greater weight loss 
(>6.5% of baseline weight) and greater improvements in 
physical fitness36.
The dose–response relationship between weight loss 
and T2DM remission over 1–2 years was evaluated in 
the Diabetes Remission Clinical Trial (DiRECT), which 
was conducted in the UK entirely in the primary care 
setting. Patients with overweight or obesity with fairly 
short-​duration T2DM (<6 years) were randomized to 
a best-​practice care group (control group) or a struc-
tured weight-​management programme that included 
the use of a very-​low-​calorie diet (~850 kcal per day) for 
3–5 months, followed by stepped food reintroduction 
(intervention group)39,40. Weight loss was significantly 
greater in the intervention group than in the control 
group (8.8-​kg difference at year 1, and 5.4-​kg difference 
at year 2; both P < 0.0001) and T2DM remission rates 
were several-​fold greater (46% in the intervention group 
versus 4% in the control group at year 1, and 36% in 
the intervention group versus 3% in the control group at 
year 2; both P < 0.0001). Furthermore, a clear dose–
response relationship was demonstrated between the 
amount of weight lost and the prevalence of T2DM 
remission39,40 (Fig. 3). Among the patients who lost 
≥15 kg, ~86% and ~70% achieved complete remission 
of their T2DM after 1 and 2 years, respectively. These 
results reinforce the primary importance of weight loss 
in T2DM remission and should shift the clinical prior-
ity of T2DM management from methods that achieve 
improvements in glycaemic control to methods that 
induce increased weight loss and long-​term management 
programmes to sustain weight loss.
It should be emphasized, however, that weight loss in 
all the aforementioned diet trials refers predominantly 
to a reduction in adipose tissue mass41. Although no 
studies are currently published that evaluate remission 
of T2DM in relation to the amount of fat and muscle 
loss, it is reasonable to assume that, for a given amount 
of weight loss, any approach that minimizes loss of mus-
cle tissue will optimize the beneficial effects of T2DM 
treatment because muscle is responsible for the majority 
of insulin-​mediated glucose disposal and is thus a key 
determinant of whole-​body insulin sensitivity42,43.
The role of diet beyond weight loss
Clearly, the amount of weight loss achieved by patients 
emerges as the cornerstone of treatment of T2DM, 
which ultimately places emphasis on the cumulative 
energy deficit and the induction of a negative energy 
balance. This energy deficit can be achieved by a reduc-
tion in total calorie intake (most commonly), but also a 
reduction in energy absorption (for example, the medi-
cation orlistat reduces fat absorption from the gastroin-
testinal tract), a decrease in appetite (for example, some 
appetite suppressant medications decrease the sensation 
of hunger and/or increase the sensation of fullness), an 
increase in energy expenditure (for example, by taking 
regular exercise), or an increase in energy loss from the 
body (for example, some medications — gliflozins — 
inhibit the reabsorption of glucose in the kidneys and 
thereby increase glucose excretion)44. Different dietary 
regimens might have the potential to optimize weight 
loss in patients with T2DM such as, for example, ad 
libitum Mediterranean diets rich in vegetable fat and 
dietary fibre45–47. More importantly, however, diets of dif-
ferent macronutrient composition48 and level of calorie 
restriction49 can have different effects on the mechanisms 
regulating glucose homeostasis, even when weight loss 
is matched. Therefore, other dietary or lifestyle factors, 
not necessarily related to the absolute amount of weight 
loss, are probably also involved in the improvement 
of glucose control in patients with T2DM.
Other factors might also affect the T2DM relapse 
rate after the initial remission achieved with dietary

interventions. For example, in the patients receiving 
the intensive lifestyle intervention in the Look AHEAD 
study, weight regain occurring between years 1 and 4 of 
follow-​up was mirrored by a rebound in HbA1c levels 
and a progressive decline in the prevalence of T2DM 
remission; by 10 years of follow-​up, the group mean 
HbA1c had returned to baseline despite sustained moder-
ate weight loss50 (Fig. 4a,b). Even though this effect could 
partly reflect worsening glucose control with ageing, 
weight regain after weight loss is an important factor 
favouring T2DM relapse. Furthermore, T2DM relapse 
can occur even when the initial weight loss is large and 
much of it is maintained in the long term51,52. These 
observations suggest that some dietary or lifestyle fac-
tors are involved in tipping the balance between T2DM 
remission and relapse independent of effects on body 
weight homeostasis.
Carbohydrate restriction. In the absence of calorie 
restriction and consequent weight loss, modifications 
to the intake of dietary macronutrients can produce 
substantial improvements in glycaemic control and 
metabolic risk factors in patients with T2DM. For 
example, well-​controlled dietary studies have shown 
that reducing dietary carbohydrate from 54% of total 
calories to 31% of total calories, whilst iso-​energetically 
increasing fat and protein contents to maintain the same 
total energy intake, significantly attenuates daily post-
prandial glucose excursions (P < 0.0001) and insulin 
responses (P < 0.001) in patients with T2DM by ~14% 
and ~22%, respectively, even after just 1–2 days53. A sim-
ilar carbohydrate-​reduced diet (from 50% to 30% of total 
calories) in patients with obesity and T2DM reduces fast-
ing glucose concentrations (P < 0.05) and HbA1c levels 
(P < 0.001) after 6 weeks, even in the absence of consid-
erable weight loss (that is, eucaloric feeding), in conjunc-
tion with significant reductions in the fat content of the 
liver (P < 0.01) and pancreas (P < 0.05)54. Based on these 
observations, it is tempting to speculate on the bene-
ficial effects of carbohydrate-​restricted diets on β-​cell 
function, given the hypothesized link between changes 
in ectopic fat deposition, hepatic VLDL secretion and 
first-​phase insulin secretion and their importance 
for weight loss-​induced remission of T2DM31,32,55. For 
instance, restricting carbohydrate intake (particularly 
simple carbohydrates) under eucaloric conditions would 
downregulate hepatic de novo lipogenesis and decrease 
VLDL triglyceride palmitate, as shown by a series of 
studies in animal models and humans in vivo56. This 
effect, in turn, could alleviate cytotoxic stress on pan-
creatic β-​cells, as results from in vitro and ex vivo mod-
els have demonstrated that palmitic acid is potentially 
the most β-​cell-​toxic saturated fatty acid32.
It is true that results from randomized trials and 
meta-​analyses regarding low-​carbohydrate diets are not 
entirely consistent57, which is possibly owing to variation 
in total energy intake and macronutrient composition, 
and the combination of studies with weight mainten­
ance and weight loss interventions. In one meta-​analysis, 
replacing carbohydrate with fat in the diet of patients 
with T2DM whilst keeping protein intake constant pro-
duced small but significant decreases in postprandial 
glucose and insulin levels, independent of energy restric-
tion and changes in body weight58. Similarly, another 
meta-​analysis demonstrated that low-​carbohydrate diets 
(replacing carbohydrate with either protein or fat, or a 
combination of both, mostly in combination with calo-
rie restriction) lead to significantly greater decreases in 
HbA1c than high-​carbohydrate diets (~0.34 percentage 
points or 3.7-​mmol/mol difference after 3–6 months; 
P = 0.02) in patients with T2DM, even for the same 
amount of weight loss47. Importantly, the magnitude of 
improvement in glycaemic control increases with the 
degree of carbohydrate restriction. Nevertheless, these 
beneficial effects are no longer apparent at 12 months 
into the intervention47, which could be owing to grad-
ually decreasing adherence to dietary carbohydrate 
restriction. Of note, other meta-​analyses did not find 
significant beneficial effects of lower carbohydrate intake 
on glycaemic control in patients with T2DM57,58. Several 
factors might confound these comparisons, such as the 
definition of low-​carbohydrate and high-​carbohydrate 
diets, the duration and intensity of the intervention,

the type of carbohydrate being replaced (for example, 
simple or complex) and the overall ‘quality’ of the diets 
(for example, food sources and extent of processing)59–61. 
The glycaemic index and the glycaemic load of the diet are 
strongly associated with the risk for T2DM, independent 
of changes in body weight and body fat. As such, manip-
ulation of the glycaemic index and load of the diet might 
have a role in the management of T2DM62,63.
Obesity and T2DM are associated with diminished 
brain glucose responses (that is, blunted rises in intrac-
erebral glucose levels) to peripheral hyperglycaemia64. 
Furthermore, brain glucose levels directly correlate with 
self-​reported feelings of satiety and fullness64. These 
observations might therefore have important implica-
tions for feeding behaviour in response to the amount 
and type of carbohydrate in the diet. Given that the 
major satiety signal in response to simple and/or refined 
carbohydrate (that is, brain blood glucose levels) is weak-
ened in T2DM, the importance of other satiety signals 
that are released mainly in response to dietary protein 
and fat (for example, cholecystokinin, GLP1 and peptide 
YY) might become more relevant65. Manipulating the 
macronutrient composition of the diet could therefore 
be important for the control of food intake in patients 
with T2DM.
It should be emphasized that carbohydrate restric-
tion should not involve restriction of dietary fibre and 
whole grain foods, as their fermentation in the large 
intestine by gut microbiota has the potential to pro-
duce short-​chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as acetate, 
which might increase satiety as shown in some animal 
models66,67. Moreover, Mendelian randomization analy­
ses of genome-​wide genotyping, gut metagenomic 
sequencing and faecal SCFA data from 952 individu-
als suggests causal links between the gut production of 
the SCFA butyrate and increased insulin response after 
an oral glucose tolerance test, as well as a link between 
abnormalities in the gut production or absorption of 
the SCFA propionate and increased risk of T2DM46,68,69. 
Overall, targeted restriction of some dietary carbohy-
drates without a reduction in total energy intake could 
provide an alternative approach to calorie restriction to 
obtain and maintain metabolic benefits in patients with 
T2DM. In addition, carbohydrate-​restricted eucaloric 
dietary interventions might be particularly beneficial for 
patients with lower degrees of obesity who cannot eas-
ily adhere to calorie-​restricted diets70 or for those with 
greater baseline metabolic derangements71.
The importance of physical activity
Regular exercise is essential for the management of 
T2DM. Many studies have demonstrated multiple 
beneficial effects of progressive aerobic and resistance 
exercise training, prescribed alone or in various com-
binations (without diet modification), on body compo-
sition (for example, reduced total body fat and visceral 
adipose tissue), cardiometabolic risk factors (for exam-
ple, improved blood lipid profile and blood pressure) 
and particularly on the mechanisms regulating glucose 
homeostasis (for example, improved insulin sensitivity 
and decreased HbA1c) in patients with T2DM72–77. All the 
above effects of regular exercise in patients with T2DM 
can be independent of accompanying changes in body 
weight (that is, weight loss)73,74,76. Furthermore, the mag-
nitude of these effects is dose-​dependent with the total 
volume (total energy expenditure) of training rather 
that depending on either exercise duration or intensity 
alone74–76,78, and is generally comparable to that of more 
conventional treatments (for example, insulin ther-
apy and oral hypoglycaemic medications)73. However, 
available evidence suggests that exercise training alone, 
without any sort of dietary advice that facilitates calo-
rie restriction and weight loss, does not readily lead to 
remission of T2DM in the majority of patients72–77.
The Malmö feasibility study was among the first to 
provide long-​term data on T2DM remission with an 
intervention that focused predominantly on an increase 
in physical activity. In this study, 41 participants with 
overweight or obesity with newly diagnosed T2DM, 
as well as generally poor physical fitness, received die-
tary advice and were offered the choice of individual or 
group-​based exercise for 5 years (39 participants com-
pleted the entire study)79. The physical training consisted 
of two weekly 60-​min sessions with various activities 
(calisthenics, walking, jogging, soccer and badminton 
playing) under the guidance of a physiotherapist, with 
exercise intensity increasing progressively, later into the 
programme80. Decreases in body weight and increases in 
fitness (maximal oxygen uptake) were greatest between 
6 months and 2 years into the intervention and were 
attenuated thereafter. At the end of the 5-​year study, 
participants had achieved a weight loss of ~3 kg and an 
increase in cardiorespiratory fitness of ~14% compared 
with baseline. Notably, the intervention brought about 
statistically significant reductions in glucose and insu-
lin responses to a standard oral glucose tolerance test, 
so that more than half (~54%) of the participants with 
T2DM were in remission (defined as no longer meeting 
diagnostic criteria for T2DM) at the 5-​year follow-​up79. 
The results of the Malmö study alleviate concerns 
around the feasibility and long-​term sustainability of 
lifestyle interventions that include physical activity to 
treat patients with T2DM. These findings are in accord-
ance with several larger (500–3,250 participants) and 
equally lengthy (3–6 years) randomized trials in patients 
with impaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes), such as 
the Diabetes Prevention Program (USA), the Diabetes 
Prevention study (Finland), and the Da Qing Diabetes 
study (China), which demonstrated beneficial effects of 
physical activity in preventing T2DM81.
A few shorter, non-​randomized and randomized con-
trolled trials that combined modest diet-​induced weight 
loss with intensive exercise training for 6–12 months 
(5–6 sessions per week of mostly supervised aero-
bic and resistance exercise, resulting in an increase 
in peak oxygen uptake of 18–23%) reported similarly 
impressive T2DM remission rates (partial or complete) 
among previously sedentary individuals82–84. Overall, 
T2DM remission rates in studies with interventions 
that included an intensive physical activity component 
were 37–80% remission after 3–10 kg of weight loss at 
0.5–5 years79,82–84, which is seemingly greater than the 
remission rates achieved in DiRECT40 or Look AHEAD36 
studies for the same amount of weight loss. Both these

large randomized controlled trials had similar weight 
loss to the aforementioned exercise intervention 
studies79,82–84; however, DiRECT, which did not include 
a physical activity component, achieved 29–34% remis-
sion after 5–10 kg of weight loss at 1–2 years40, and the 
Look AHEAD study, which included a less intensive 
physical activity component, achieved 8–12% remission 
after 5–9 kg of weight loss at 1–4 years36. Moreover, in the 
Look AHEAD study, T2DM remission rates were nota-
bly higher among patients with greater improvements 
in fitness36. These findings collectively suggest that an 
increase in physical activity and fitness, within a compre-
hensive lifestyle modification programme, is probably 
an important contributor to T2DM remission, particu-
larly when weight loss is moderate; the importance of 
exercise training may be less when weight loss becomes 
greater (for example, ≥15% of baseline weight induced 
by hypocaloric diet39 or bariatric surgery85) and T2DM 
remission becomes nearly complete.
Diet interventions for prediabetes
Patients with overweight and obesity show considerable 
interindividual variability in the weight loss response 
across dietary treatments86; however, individual patients 
are often assumed by clinicians to respond similarly to 
the various diet prescriptions. Although specific dietary 
recommendations have been drawn up for T2DM, which 
are continuously being revised87, individuals without 
T2DM have largely been treated by both clinicians and 
researchers alike as a homogeneous group. Nevertheless, 
variation in baseline glycaemic control in people with 
overweight and obesity but without T2DM, such as the 
presence of normoglycaemia or prediabetes, might lead 
to variable weight loss success and metabolic respon­
ses to dietary treatment46. In the USA, the prevalence of 
prediabetes has been progressively climbing, from 20% 
of the adult population in 2000 to 37% in 2012, and this 
figure is projected to rise to 40% in 2030 (ref.88). People 
with prediabetes have a considerably increased risk of 
T2DM88; however, weight loss induced by lifestyle mod-
ification can decrease this risk by ~50%81,89. This has 
been shown consistently in major randomized studies 
such as the US90 and Finnish91 diabetes prevention trials, 
which included 500–3,250 individuals with prediabetes 
and achieved 5–7% weight loss with a combination of 
dietary restriction and increased physical activity (150–
210 min/week) over ~3 years. A similar reduction in 
the risk of T2DM was found in the Chinese Da Qing 
Diabetes Prevention study, which achieved only mild 
weight loss (2–3 kg) and focused mostly on increasing 
physical activity for 6 years92. Remarkably, the benefi-
cial effects of lifestyle modification to prevent or delay 
T2DM can persist for an impressive 14 years after the 
active intervention93. Therefore, helping the growing 
number of patients with prediabetes lose weight (or 
prevent further weight gain) can be an effective strategy 
for reducing overall rates of T2DM.
The importance of baseline glycaemia. A review from 
2018 identified a considerable number of studies that 
investigated preintervention measures of glycaemia and 
insulinaemia to determine whether they could be useful 
biomarkers to predict weight loss among individuals 
with normoglycaemia and prediabetes following specific 
diets46. To a greater extent than insulin, the level of base-
line fasting glucose was found to be a potent prognostic 
marker of weight loss success. Furthermore, evidence 
suggested that, among participants with prediabetes, 
the overall macronutrient composition of the diet was 
of little importance; however, the quality of dietary 
carbohydrate was extremely important for weight loss 
and weight loss maintenance46.
In the Supermarket Intervention study (SHOPUS, 
Denmark), participants with increased waist circumfer-
ence (≥80 cm for women and ≥94 cm for men) were ran-
domized either to the New Nordic Diet or the Average 
Danish Diet for 6 months94. The New Nordic Diet is 
based on the consumption of high-​quality carbohydrates 
and generally comprises local and minimally processed 
foods (for example, berries, cabbages, root vegetables, 
legumes, potatoes, fresh herbs, wild plants and mush-
rooms, nuts, whole grains, meats from livestock and 
game, fish and shellfish, and seaweed), whereas the 
Average Danish Diet is similar to a Western control diet 
and comprises foods such as refined grains including 
pasta and rice, meat, dairy and cheese, sugary products, 
convenience foods and, to a lesser extent, low-​fibre veg-
etables and imported fruit94. Participants were instructed 
to eat both diets ad libitum; to increase adherence, 
cookbooks and all foods were provided free of charge 
at a specially designed supermarket at the University 
of Copenhagen, and barcodes were scanned to ensure 
foods were consumed according to the randomization 
group. When stratifying by baseline fasting plasma 
glucose concentrations, we found that individuals with 
prediabetes lost 6.0 kg more on the New Nordic Diet 
than on the Average Danish Diet, whereas normogly-
caemic individuals lost only 2.2 kg more95. Using a novel 
statistical approach for estimating truly individualized 
treatment effects, we found that the New Nordic Diet 
produces a 3.0-​kg greater weight loss than the Average 
Danish Diet for every 1 mmol/l increase in baseline 
fasting plasma glucose concentration96 (Fig. 5a,b). These 
findings suggest the importance of baseline glycaemic 
control for weight loss success.
In the Monounsaturated Fatty Acids in Obesity study 
(MUFOBES, Denmark), participants with overweight 
and obesity initially lost ~12 kg on a low-​calorie diet and 
were subsequently randomized to one of three different 
ad libitum diets for 6 months97: a high-​monounsaturated 
fat diet; a low-​fat (20–30% of total energy intake) 
high-​fibre (>30 g/10 MJ) diet similar to the New Nordic 
Diet; or the Average Danish Diet. Again, all foods were 
provided free of charge at a specially designed super-
market. When participants were stratified according to 
initial fasting plasma glucose levels, those with predia-
betes did not regain any weight on the New Nordic-​like 
Diet whereas those on the Average Danish Diet regained 
4.2 kg, resulting in lower weight regain on the former diet 
than the latter (−4.2 kg, 95% CI −6.8 to −1.6, P = 0.002), 
whereas no such difference was observed among nor-
moglycaemic individuals, who regained 2.1–2.5 kg on 
both diets98. Using the aforementioned novel statistical 
approach96, we demonstrated that the New Nordic-​like

treatment.

Fig. 5 | Differences in diet-induced changes in body weight according to baseline fasting plasma glucose 
concentrations. In three separate analyses (one for each of the SHOPUS94, MUFOBES97 and DIOGENES99 trials), 
differences in changes in body weight from baseline to 6 months were estimated using a linear mixed model, which 
included fasting plasma glucose-​by-​diet interactions, as well as age and sex (and low-​calorie diet in MUFOBES and 
DIOGENES) as fixed effects and subject-​specific random effects96. For SHOPUS, weight changes after 6 months on the 
New Nordic Diet (NND) or the Average Danish Diet (ADD) in relationship to baseline fasting glucose (part a) were used to 
calculate the difference between diets (part b). The slope for the difference between the NND and the ADD was 3.0 kg per 
mmol/l (95% CI 1.2 to 4.8 kg per mmol/l, P = 0.001) (ADD 0.6, 95% CI −0.9 to 2.2, P = 0.43; NND −2.4, 95% CI −1.5 to −3.3, 
P < 0.001). For MUFOBES, weight changes after an initial period of diet-​induced weight loss followed by 6 months on the 
NND or the ADD in relationship to baseline fasting glucose (part c) were used to calculate the difference between diets 
(part d). The slope for the difference between the NND and ADD was 7.3 kg per mmol/l (95% CI 3.2 to 11.4 kg per mmol/l, 
P < 0.001) (ADD 4.9, 95% CI 1.8 to 8.1, P = 0.002; NND −2.3, 95% CI −4.9 to 0.2, P = 0.073). For DIOGENES, weight changes 
after an initial period of diet-​induced weight loss followed by 6 months on the lowest glycaemic load (LGL) diet or the 
highest glycaemic load (HGL) diet in relationship to baseline fasting glucose (part e) were used to calculate the difference 
between diets (part f). The slope for the difference between the LGL diet and the HGL diet was 1.8 kg per mmol/l (95% CI 
0.1 to 3.5 kg per mmol/l, P = 0.038) (HGL 1.6, 95% CI 0.2 to 2.9, P = 0.020; LGL −0.2, 95% CI −1.3 to 0.8, P = 0.67).

In the pan-​European Diet, Obesity, and Genes 
(DIOGENES) trial, individuals with overweight and 
obesity achieved an initial weight loss of ~11 kg by 
consuming a low-​calorie diet for 2 months and were 
then randomized to one of five ad libitum diets, which 
differed in glycaemic index and protein content for 
6 months99. Overall, participants who were assigned to 
the highest glycaemic load diet (that is, high glycaemic 
index and low protein) regained 1.9 kg more than those 
randomized to the lowest glycaemic load diet (that is, 
low glycaemic index and high protein)99. When rea-
nalysing the results, we found that participants with 
prediabetes regained 5.8 kg more (95% CI 3.3 to 8.3 kg, 
P < 0.001) on the highest glycaemic load diet than those 
on the lowest glycaemic load diet, whereas normogly-
caemic individuals regained only 1.4 kg more (95% CI 
0.5 to 2.4 kg, P = 0.003), resulting in a 4.4-​kg difference 
(95% CI 1.8 to 7.0 kg, P = 0.001) in the responsiveness 
to the diets between glycaemic groups95. As above, we 
demonstrated that the lowest glycaemic diet produces 
1.8-​kg smaller weight regain than the highest glycaemic 
load diet for every 1 mmol/l increase in baseline fast-
ing plasma glucose concentration (Fig. 5e,f). The two 
low glycaemic index diets in the DIOGENES trial (with 
low or high protein content) produced a 1.2-​kg (95% CI 
0.3 to 2.2 kg, P = 0.01) smaller weight regain for every 
1 mmol/l increase in baseline fasting plasma glucose 
concentration compared with the two high glycaemic 
index diets (with low or high protein content). By con-
trast, no significant differences were found between the 
two high-​protein and the two low-​protein diets (−0.4 kg, 
95% CI −1.3 to 0.6 kg, P = 0.48). Overall, these findings 
suggest an interaction between baseline glycaemic con-
trol and the amount and quality of dietary carbohydrate 
for optimal weight loss maintenance.
These observations are also in line with the results 
from a randomized, placebo-​controlled, double-​blind 
clinical trial of a novel hydrogel that was designed to 
mimic the viscoelastic properties of leafy vegetables 
(that is, cellulosic-​based composition and mechanical 
properties)100. Patients with overweight and obesity were 
prescribed a hypocaloric diet of 300 kcal per day below 
their calculated energy requirements and were rand-
omized to hydrogel or placebo for 24 weeks. Compared 
with patients treated with placebo, those treated with 
the hydrogel lost 2.1% more of their baseline weight 
(P = 0.0007) and had two times greater odds of achieving 
≥10% weight loss (P = 0.0107). Notably, among the sub-
group of patients with prediabetes (defined according 
to fasting plasma glucose levels at baseline), the odds 
of achieving ≥10% weight loss were approximately six 
times greater in the hydrogel group than in the placebo 
group (P = 0.0071)100.
Summary. Collectively, these observations suggest that 
patients with prediabetes might experience greater 
weight loss and avoid or minimize weight regain, even 
without being prescribed a calorie-​restricted diet, 
when they follow an ad libitum diet that includes low-​
glycaemic index carbohydrate and increased amounts of 
dietary fibre. These observations, albeit interesting, have 
been produced by post-​hoc analyses of data from larger 
trials; therefore, they should be interpreted with caution, 
particularly owing to the presence of many confounding 
factors and the absence of randomized controlled stud-
ies. In our statistical models, we adjusted for age, sex 
and baseline body weight, as these parameters differed 
or tended to differ among groups that were stratified 
by baseline glycaemia. Residual confounding cannot 
be excluded; however, these findings95,96,98 could not be 
explained by differences in baseline carbohydrate or fibre 
intakes as these were not different between normogly-
caemic participants and those with prediabetes. All the 
reanalysed trials were double-​blinded with respect to 
the glycaemic status of the participants, and identified 
differences in dietary responsiveness therefore can-
not have been influenced by researcher bias. Finally, 
the available measures in the three studies reanalysed 
indicate that fasting insulin and the homeostasis model 
assessment of insulin resistance, insulin secretion 
indexes, glucose tolerance (2-​h glucose concentration 
measured by a standard oral glucose tolerance test) and 
long-​term glycaemic control (HbA1c) are less predictive 
of weight loss success than fasting glucose levels. To 
move this field forward, it is important to conduct ran-
domized controlled trials of adequate size and duration, 
in which individuals with different levels of baseline gly-
caemic control are randomly assigned to different types 
of diets for both weight loss and weight maintenance.
Conclusions
A substantial dietary energy restriction has been proven 
to be a very successful method of producing rapid 
and major weight loss in individuals with overweight and 
obesity with T2DM. The achievement of weight loss 
in excess of 10–15 kg is key for T2DM remission; how-
ever, other factors including carbohydrate restriction 
and increased physical activity might help maximize 
the achieved metabolic benefits. Future studies should 
address this possibility in a systematic way. For example, 
exercise training is a potent intervention that improves 
glucose homeostasis and could also help in the control 
of body weight, but its contribution to T2DM remis-
sion within a comprehensive lifestyle modification pro-
gramme is largely unexplored. Unfortunately, long-​term 
maintenance of weight loss has been a major challenge 
owing to hunger and a lack of sufficient postprandial 
satiety signals, which contribute to decreasing adher-
ence to the diet prescription over time101–103. This lack 
of adherence is probably a main reason for the generally 
low effectiveness observed when instructing patients to 
substantially alter their diet (for example, by replacing 
carbohydrate with fat or protein) for ≥1 year without 
providing the whole diet itself or at least some key food 
pro­ducts. This observation calls for more studies to better 
understand factors that foster long-​term adherence.
Comparisons between low-​fat and low-​carbohydrate 
diets have not led to any consistent results in unse-
lected populations with obesity; however, retrospective 
analyses95,96,98 from randomized controlled trials94,97,99 
have demonstrated the potential for much greater suc-
cess in achieving satiety and body weight control among 
people with prediabetes, and probably also in those with 
T2DM, when using a personalized, precision dietary

management approach based on glucose-​related meta-
bolic traits (that is, fasting glucose levels). The effective-
ness of this approach for selecting the optimal dietary 
treatment for weight loss and metabolic improvements 
in patients with prediabetes and T2DM needs to be 
further tested in prospective randomized clinical trials 
before translation of these exciting new findings into 
clinical practice.
