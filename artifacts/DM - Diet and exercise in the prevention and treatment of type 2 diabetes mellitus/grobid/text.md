An intermediate condition between normoglycaemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus, characterized by moderately elevated fasting or postprandial blood glucose or HbA 1c .

The worldwide prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in adults has increased from ~150 million affected people in 2000 to >450 million in 2019 and is projected to rise further to ~700 million by 2045 (ref. 1 ). Genetics and lifestyle habits (such as consumption of a high-sugar diet and a sedentary lifestyle) can have a predisposing influence as T2DM occurs at varying rates in people of different racial and/or ethnic backgrounds 2 . In addition, the level of adiposity can affect the risk of T2DM. For example, the prevalence of T2DM increases proportionally with increasing BMI; however, the disease can occur even among those with body weight in the normal range 2 . The excess accumulation of adipose tissue in the body negatively affects nearly all physiological functions and organ systems, and increases the risk of cardiometabolic disease 3 . Large prospective studies have demonstrated that an increase in body weight over time considerably increases the incidence of T2DM 4 (fig. 1 ). Likewise, an increase in BMI of 5 kg/m 2 , from the upper limit of normal BMI (25 kg/m 2 ) to the lower limit of obesity (30 kg/m 2 ), more than doubles the risk of death associated with T2DM 5 . Evidence clearly indicates, however, that the risk of T2DM increases with increasing BMI well before clinical obesity is diagnosed [6] [7] [8] .

The mechanisms responsible for the tight link between weight gain and the development of prediabetes and T2DM are not completely clear; however, excessive accumulation of fat in the body increases insulin resistance and brings about other subtle metabolic changes, well before T2DM is diagnosed 9 . For example, obesity is associated with increased fatty acid release into the circulation 10 , decreased insulin sensitivity in muscle, liver and adipose tissue 11 , and excessive fat accumulation in adipose tissue and liver 12 , as well as potentially in other organs (for example, pancreas and skeletal muscle) 13 ; these metabolic alterations can occur even before abnormalities in glucose homeostasis manifest. Early in the natural history of T2DM, metabolic alterations that are associated with fat accumulation are accompanied by gradual and only minor increases in fasting and postprandial hyperglycaemia (that is, prediabetes), owing to a compensatory increase in pancreatic insulin secretion (hyperinsulinaemia) that helps mask the effects of insulin resistance and maintains normal glycaemic control 14, 15 (fig. 2 ). Eventually, however, β-cells begin to fail and insulin secretion can no longer keep up with the increased demand for insulin; therefore, fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations rise further and the diagnosis of T2DM ensues 14, 15 (fig. 2 ). The close relationship between increasing body fatness and T2DM has led to the connotation 'diabesity' , which highlights the fact that many individuals with T2DM also have overweight or obesity and also highlights the need for combined treatment strategies 16, 17 .

In this Review, we highlight large randomized clinical trials that provide evidence of T2DM remission after weight loss induced by intensive diet-based lifestyle programmes, alongside findings from smaller, well-controlled and mechanistic studies. We consider the role of macronutrient composition of the diet, including carbohydrate quality and/or restriction. We also discuss results showing that physical activity can contribute to T2DM remission when combined with diet-induced weight loss. Finally, we cover preliminary findings that suggest that individuals with prediabetes can be stratified according to metabolic status to optimize recommendations of dietary composition for long-term weight loss maintenance and thereby prevent progression to T2DM.

Studies have repeatedly shown the importance of body weight control for the management of T2DM 16 . Data from the Swedish Obese Subjects study 18 and the Scandinavian Obesity Surgery registry 19 demonstrate that major weight loss 2 years after bariatric surgery is accompanied by complete remission of T2DM in 72% and 58% of patients with T2DM, respectively. Likewise, patients with T2DM who are treated with glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) analogues have associated weight loss, which is accompanied by sixfold to tenfold greater odds for T2DM remission (defined as HbA 1c ≤6.5%) than with placebo 20 . However, both bariatric surgery and medications can have important weight loss-independent effects on glucose metabolism. For example, GLP1 analogues stimulate insulin secretion and perhaps also increase insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues 21, 22 . Furthermore, postprandial levels of GLP1 and other incretins are substantially increased by certain bariatric surgery procedures (for example, gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy) 21 . Therefore, the aforementioned findings do not allow researchers to distinguish between the effects of weight loss per se and weight loss-independent mechanisms on T2DM remission.

Weight loss induced solely by dietary calorie restriction dose-dependently improves body composition by progressively decreasing total body fat, intra-abdominal fat (known as visceral adipose tissue) and intrahepatic lipid content 23 . Moderate diet-induced weight loss (~5% of baseline body weight) in nondiabetic individuals with obesity and metabolic dysfunction decreases fasting blood glucose and insulin concentrations, increases insulin sensitivity in the liver, adipose tissue and muscle, and improves β-cell function. Additional weight loss (11-16% of baseline body weight) further improves muscle insulin sensitivity and β-cell function 23 . Accordingly, progressively greater weight loss (from no change to >14% loss of baseline body weight) in patients with obesity and T2DM is associated with progressively increasing reductions in fasting glucose, insulin and HbA 1c concentrations; that is, stepwise improvements in glycaemic control 24 .

Mechanistic studies showed that diet-induced weight loss (6-17 kg) in patients with obesity and T2DM decreased fasting glucose concentrations predominantly owing to augmented suppression of basal hepatic glucose production (that is, improved hepatic insulin sensitivity) 25, 26 . Furthermore, the decrease in postprandial glucose concentrations occurred predominantly due to augmented stimulation of peripheral glucose uptake (that is, improved muscle insulin sensitivity) 25 . Several small but well-controlled studies in patients with obesity and T2DM have demonstrated that considerable weight loss (>15 kg or ~15% of baseline body weight) induced by calorie restriction over a fairly short period of time (1.5-6 months) brings about substantial reductions of fasting blood glucose and HbA 1c levels for most patients, which can lead to the normalization of these parameters in some patients [27] [28] [29] .

In one such mechanistic study of 11 patients with overweight or obesity with short-duration T2DM (<4 years), a weight loss of ~15.3 kg (~15% of baseline weight) achieved over 8 weeks by a very-low-calorie diet was associated with decreased fat content in the liver and pancreas as well as increased first-phase insulin

• Studies show that weight loss can produce remission of type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2Dm) in a dose-dependent manner. • In patients with t2Dm and obesity, weight loss of ~15 kg, achieved by an intensive management programme involving calorie restriction, can lead to remission of t2Dm in ~80% of individuals. • long-term maintenance of weight loss and metabolic health in people who have undergone intensive lifestyle intervention is challenging. • carbohydrate restriction might help maintain weight loss and maximize metabolic benefits. • When combined with calorie restriction and weight loss, increases in physical activity and fitness are an important contributor to t2Dm remission. • Preliminary work suggests that pretreatment glycaemic status could be used to stratify patients in order to optimize dietary recommendations.

Relative risk of T2DM 0 0 secretion, and led to remission of T2DM in all patients 30 . These results were striking because of the demonstration that weight loss can restore first-phase insulin secretion in patients with T2DM; this effect is probably an integral mechanism for remission. This hypothesis was supported by the results of several subsequent trials that assessed the effects of weight loss on T2DM remission after dietary interventions ranging in duration from 5 months to 2 years. These studies found that patients who responded to treatment were characterized by shorter T2DM duration and an increase in first-phase insulin secretion after weight loss, which did not occur in patients who did not respond to treatment despite similar weight loss 31, 32 . Likewise, reductions in pancreatic fat, liver fat and hepatic very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglyceride secretion rate were more pronounced among the patients who responded to treatment than in patients who did not respond to treatment 31, 32 .

Interestingly, one study also reported on the characteristics of those who achieved remission at 5 months into the weight loss intervention but subsequently relapsed to redevelop T2DM at 2 years of follow-up 32 . Compared with individuals with durable remission, patients who relapsed regained more weight from 5 months to 2 years of follow-up and showed substantial rebounds in the fat content of the pancreas and liver, hepatic VLDL triglyceride secretion rate and increases in VLDL triglyceride palmitate content, as well as a complete return to baseline in first-phase insulin secretion 32 . Therefore, an increased ability of the pancreas to secrete insulin and the restoration of first-phase insulin secretion -in other words, the capacity to recover β-cell function -has emerged as a key factor for T2DM remission after weight loss.

It is less clear from the results of these studies [30] [31] [32] whether β-cell recovery in patients who respond to treatment depends in a causal manner to the decrease in ectopic fat accumulation in these individuals; similarly it remains unknown whether the rebound in ectopic fat content in patients who relapsed is the cause of β-cell function returning to baseline. The β-cells may well have a threshold for lipid-related insults and stress from various sources (for example, excess liver fat and augmented VLDL triglyceride secretion, more circulating free fatty acids and excess pancreatic fat) that renders them less responsive to weight loss, particularly with regard to longer-duration T2DM 33 . The coordinated changes in VLDL triglyceride palmitate content that accompany T2DM remission and relapse in patients who underwent diet-induced weight loss highlight a possible causal link, as palmitic acid (the primary product of hepatic de novo lipogenesis) is particularly cytotoxic against β-cells in vitro 32 . These observations support the view that the optimal time to intervene for reversing T2DM is at the time of diagnosis 34 . Nonetheless, a low-calorie intervention with total diet replacement can lead to substantial reductions in body weight and considerable improvements in glycaemic control, and thus diminish insulin burden, even among patients with long-standing T2DM who are treated with insulin 35 .

A few large randomized controlled trials have reported on the relationship between weight loss achieved by lifestyle modification and remission of T2DM. For example, in the Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) study, a multi-centre trial conducted in the USA, participants were randomized to intensive lifestyle intervention, Accordingly, fasting glucose levels above the light blue band and 2-h glucose levels above the dark blue band are indicative of T2DM. Data originally presented in ref. 14 .

which focused on the adoption of an energy-prudent diet (1200-1800 kcal per day) and a physically active lifestyle (175 min of moderate-intensity physical activity per week) or a control group 36 . Participants in the lifestyle intervention group lost significantly more weight during the first 4 years than participants randomized to the control group (8.6% versus 0.7%, respectively, at year 1; and 4.7% versus 0.8%, respectively, at year 4; both P < 0.001), and had greater increases in fitness, as well as a 6.6-fold greater prevalence of T2DM remission (partial or complete, defined respectively as the transition from meeting T2DM criteria to the prediabetes level of glycaemia or to the full normalization of glycaemia, without T2DM medication) 36 . However, absolute remission rates were low (11.5% at year 1 and 7.3% at year 4 in the intervention group), which is probably owing to the modest amount of weight loss achieved and the wide range of T2DM duration at baseline (median of 5 years with an interquartile range of 8 years) 36 , or even the composition of the prescribed diet 37 . Although participants in the intensive lifestyle intervention group reduced their calorie intake, this was achieved predominantly by restricting consumption of dietary fat rather than carbohydrate; as a result, the percentage of energy obtained from carbohydrate increased 38 , which might have limited the efficacy of the diet (see below). Remission of T2DM at any time during follow-up was more likely for individuals with a shorter duration of T2DM (<2 years), greater weight loss (>6.5% of baseline weight) and greater improvements in physical fitness 36 .

The dose-response relationship between weight loss and T2DM remission over 1-2 years was evaluated in the Diabetes Remission Clinical Trial (DiRECT), which was conducted in the UK entirely in the primary care setting. Patients with overweight or obesity with fairly short-duration T2DM (<6 years) were randomized to a best-practice care group (control group) or a structured weight-management programme that included the use of a very-low-calorie diet (~850 kcal per day) for 3-5 months, followed by stepped food reintroduction (intervention group) 39, 40 . Weight loss was significantly greater in the intervention group than in the control group (8.8-kg difference at year 1, and 5.4-kg difference at year 2; both P < 0.0001) and T2DM remission rates were several-fold greater (46% in the intervention group versus 4% in the control group at year 1, and 36% in the intervention group versus 3% in the control group at year 2; both P < 0.0001). Furthermore, a clear doseresponse relationship was demonstrated between the amount of weight lost and the prevalence of T2DM remission 39,40 (fig. 3 ). Among the patients who lost ≥15 kg, ~86% and ~70% achieved complete remission of their T2DM after 1 and 2 years, respectively. These results reinforce the primary importance of weight loss in T2DM remission and should shift the clinical priority of T2DM management from methods that achieve improvements in glycaemic control to methods that induce increased weight loss and long-term management programmes to sustain weight loss.

It should be emphasized, however, that weight loss in all the aforementioned diet trials refers predominantly to a reduction in adipose tissue mass 41 . Although no studies are currently published that evaluate remission of T2DM in relation to the amount of fat and muscle loss, it is reasonable to assume that, for a given amount of weight loss, any approach that minimizes loss of muscle tissue will optimize the beneficial effects of T2DM treatment because muscle is responsible for the majority of insulin-mediated glucose disposal and is thus a key determinant of whole-body insulin sensitivity 42, 43 .

Clearly, the amount of weight loss achieved by patients emerges as the cornerstone of treatment of T2DM, which ultimately places emphasis on the cumulative energy deficit and the induction of a negative energy balance. This energy deficit can be achieved by a reduction in total calorie intake (most commonly), but also a reduction in energy absorption (for example, the medication orlistat reduces fat absorption from the gastrointestinal tract), a decrease in appetite (for example, some appetite suppressant medications decrease the sensation of hunger and/or increase the sensation of fullness), an increase in energy expenditure (for example, by taking regular exercise), or an increase in energy loss from the body (for example, some medications -gliflozinsinhibit the reabsorption of glucose in the kidneys and thereby increase glucose excretion) 44 . Different dietary regimens might have the potential to optimize weight loss in patients with T2DM such as, for example, ad libitum Mediterranean diets rich in vegetable fat and dietary fibre [45] [46] [47] . More importantly, however, diets of different macronutrient composition 48 and level of calorie restriction 49 can have different effects on the mechanisms regulating glucose homeostasis, even when weight loss is matched. Therefore, other dietary or lifestyle factors, not necessarily related to the absolute amount of weight loss, are probably also involved in the improvement of glucose control in patients with T2DM.

Other factors might also affect the T2DM relapse rate after the initial remission achieved with dietary interventions. For example, in the patients receiving the intensive lifestyle intervention in the Look AHEAD study, weight regain occurring between years 1 and 4 of follow-up was mirrored by a rebound in HbA 1c levels and a progressive decline in the prevalence of T2DM remission; by 10 years of follow-up, the group mean HbA 1c had returned to baseline despite sustained moderate weight loss 50 (fig. 4a, b ). Even though this effect could partly reflect worsening glucose control with ageing, weight regain after weight loss is an important factor favouring T2DM relapse. Furthermore, T2DM relapse can occur even when the initial weight loss is large and much of it is maintained in the long term 51, 52 . These observations suggest that some dietary or lifestyle factors are involved in tipping the balance between T2DM remission and relapse independent of effects on body weight homeostasis.

In the absence of calorie restriction and consequent weight loss, modifications to the intake of dietary macronutrients can produce substantial improvements in glycaemic control and metabolic risk factors in patients with T2DM. For example, well-controlled dietary studies have shown that reducing dietary carbohydrate from 54% of total calories to 31% of total calories, whilst iso-energetically increasing fat and protein contents to maintain the same total energy intake, significantly attenuates daily postprandial glucose excursions (P < 0.0001) and insulin responses (P < 0.001) in patients with T2DM by ~14% and ~22%, respectively, even after just 1-2 days 53 . A similar carbohydrate-reduced diet (from 50% to 30% of total calories) in patients with obesity and T2DM reduces fasting glucose concentrations (P < 0.05) and HbA 1c levels (P < 0.001) after 6 weeks, even in the absence of considerable weight loss (that is, eucaloric feeding), in conjunction with significant reductions in the fat content of the liver (P < 0.01) and pancreas (P < 0.05) 54 . Based on these observations, it is tempting to speculate on the beneficial effects of carbohydrate-restricted diets on β-cell function, given the hypothesized link between changes in ectopic fat deposition, hepatic VLDL secretion and first-phase insulin secretion and their importance for weight loss-induced remission of T2DM 31, 32, 55 . For instance, restricting carbohydrate intake (particularly simple carbohydrates) under eucaloric conditions would downregulate hepatic de novo lipogenesis and decrease VLDL triglyceride palmitate, as shown by a series of studies in animal models and humans in vivo 56 . This effect, in turn, could alleviate cytotoxic stress on pancreatic β-cells, as results from in vitro and ex vivo models have demonstrated that palmitic acid is potentially the most β-cell-toxic saturated fatty acid 32 .

It is true that results from randomized trials and meta-analyses regarding low-carbohydrate diets are not entirely consistent 57 , which is possibly owing to variation in total energy intake and macronutrient composition, and the combination of studies with weight maintenance and weight loss interventions. In one meta-analysis, replacing carbohydrate with fat in the diet of patients with T2DM whilst keeping protein intake constant produced small but significant decreases in postprandial glucose and insulin levels, independent of energy restriction and changes in body weight 58 . Similarly, another meta-analysis demonstrated that low-carbohydrate diets (replacing carbohydrate with either protein or fat, or a combination of both, mostly in combination with calorie restriction) lead to significantly greater decreases in HbA 1c than high-carbohydrate diets (~0.34 percentage points or 3.7-mmol/mol difference after 3-6 months; P = 0.02) in patients with T2DM, even for the same amount of weight loss 47 . Importantly, the magnitude of improvement in glycaemic control increases with the degree of carbohydrate restriction. Nevertheless, these beneficial effects are no longer apparent at 12 months into the intervention 47 , which could be owing to gradually decreasing adherence to dietary carbohydrate restriction. Of note, other meta-analyses did not find significant beneficial effects of lower carbohydrate intake on glycaemic control in patients with T2DM 57, 58 . Several factors might confound these comparisons, such as the definition of low-carbohydrate and high-carbohydrate diets, the duration and intensity of the intervention, the type of carbohydrate being replaced (for example, simple or complex) and the overall 'quality' of the diets (for example, food sources and extent of processing) [59] [60] [61] . The glycaemic index and the glycaemic load of the diet are strongly associated with the risk for T2DM, independent of changes in body weight and body fat. As such, manipulation of the glycaemic index and load of the diet might have a role in the management of T2DM 62, 63 .

Obesity and T2DM are associated with diminished brain glucose responses (that is, blunted rises in intracerebral glucose levels) to peripheral hyperglycaemia 64 . Furthermore, brain glucose levels directly correlate with self-reported feelings of satiety and fullness 64 . These observations might therefore have important implications for feeding behaviour in response to the amount and type of carbohydrate in the diet. Given that the major satiety signal in response to simple and/or refined carbohydrate (that is, brain blood glucose levels) is weakened in T2DM, the importance of other satiety signals that are released mainly in response to dietary protein and fat (for example, cholecystokinin, GLP1 and peptide YY) might become more relevant 65 . Manipulating the macronutrient composition of the diet could therefore be important for the control of food intake in patients with T2DM.

It should be emphasized that carbohydrate restriction should not involve restriction of dietary fibre and whole grain foods, as their fermentation in the large intestine by gut microbiota has the potential to produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as acetate, which might increase satiety as shown in some animal models 66, 67 . Moreover, Mendelian randomization analyses of genome-wide genotyping, gut metagenomic sequencing and faecal SCFA data from 952 individuals suggests causal links between the gut production of the SCFA butyrate and increased insulin response after an oral glucose tolerance test, as well as a link between abnormalities in the gut production or absorption of the SCFA propionate and increased risk of T2DM 46, 68, 69 . Overall, targeted restriction of some dietary carbohydrates without a reduction in total energy intake could provide an alternative approach to calorie restriction to obtain and maintain metabolic benefits in patients with T2DM. In addition, carbohydrate-restricted eucaloric dietary interventions might be particularly beneficial for patients with lower degrees of obesity who cannot easily adhere to calorie-restricted diets 70 or for those with greater baseline metabolic derangements 71 .

Regular exercise is essential for the management of T2DM. Many studies have demonstrated multiple beneficial effects of progressive aerobic and resistance exercise training, prescribed alone or in various combinations (without diet modification), on body composition (for example, reduced total body fat and visceral adipose tissue), cardiometabolic risk factors (for example, improved blood lipid profile and blood pressure) and particularly on the mechanisms regulating glucose homeostasis (for example, improved insulin sensitivity and decreased HbA 1c ) in patients with T2DM [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] . All the above effects of regular exercise in patients with T2DM can be independent of accompanying changes in body weight (that is, weight loss) 73, 74, 76 . Furthermore, the magnitude of these effects is dose-dependent with the total volume (total energy expenditure) of training rather that depending on either exercise duration or intensity alone [74] [75] [76] 78 , and is generally comparable to that of more conventional treatments (for example, insulin therapy and oral hypoglycaemic medications) 73 . However, available evidence suggests that exercise training alone, without any sort of dietary advice that facilitates calorie restriction and weight loss, does not readily lead to remission of T2DM in the majority of patients [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] .

The Malmö feasibility study was among the first to provide long-term data on T2DM remission with an intervention that focused predominantly on an increase in physical activity. In this study, 41 participants with overweight or obesity with newly diagnosed T2DM, as well as generally poor physical fitness, received dietary advice and were offered the choice of individual or group-based exercise for 5 years (39 participants completed the entire study) 79 . The physical training consisted of two weekly 60-min sessions with various activities (calisthenics, walking, jogging, soccer and badminton playing) under the guidance of a physiotherapist, with exercise intensity increasing progressively, later into the programme 80 . Decreases in body weight and increases in fitness (maximal oxygen uptake) were greatest between 6 months and 2 years into the intervention and were attenuated thereafter. At the end of the 5-year study, participants had achieved a weight loss of ~3 kg and an increase in cardiorespiratory fitness of ~14% compared with baseline. Notably, the intervention brought about statistically significant reductions in glucose and insulin responses to a standard oral glucose tolerance test, so that more than half (~54%) of the participants with T2DM were in remission (defined as no longer meeting diagnostic criteria for T2DM) at the 5-year follow-up 79 . The results of the Malmö study alleviate concerns around the feasibility and long-term sustainability of lifestyle interventions that include physical activity to treat patients with T2DM. These findings are in accordance with several larger (500-3,250 participants) and equally lengthy (3-6 years) randomized trials in patients with impaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes), such as the Diabetes Prevention Program (USA), the Diabetes Prevention study (Finland), and the Da Qing Diabetes study (China), which demonstrated beneficial effects of physical activity in preventing T2DM 81 .

A few shorter, non-randomized and randomized controlled trials that combined modest diet-induced weight loss with intensive exercise training for 6-12 months (5-6 sessions per week of mostly supervised aerobic and resistance exercise, resulting in an increase in peak oxygen uptake of 18-23%) reported similarly impressive T2DM remission rates (partial or complete) among previously sedentary individuals [82] [83] [84] . Overall, T2DM remission rates in studies with interventions that included an intensive physical activity component were 37-80% remission after 3-10 kg of weight loss at 0.5-5 years 79, [82] [83] [84] , which is seemingly greater than the remission rates achieved in DiRECT 40 or Look AHEAD 36 studies for the same amount of weight loss. Both these

large randomized controlled trials had similar weight loss to the aforementioned exercise intervention studies 79, [82] [83] [84] ; however, DiRECT, which did not include a physical activity component, achieved 29-34% remission after 5-10 kg of weight loss at 1-2 years 40 , and the Look AHEAD study, which included a less intensive physical activity component, achieved 8-12% remission after 5-9 kg of weight loss at 1-4 years 36 . Moreover, in the Look AHEAD study, T2DM remission rates were notably higher among patients with greater improvements in fitness 36 . These findings collectively suggest that an increase in physical activity and fitness, within a comprehensive lifestyle modification programme, is probably an important contributor to T2DM remission, particularly when weight loss is moderate; the importance of exercise training may be less when weight loss becomes greater (for example, ≥15% of baseline weight induced by hypocaloric diet 39 or bariatric surgery 85 ) and T2DM remission becomes nearly complete.

Patients with overweight and obesity show considerable interindividual variability in the weight loss response across dietary treatments 86 ; however, individual patients are often assumed by clinicians to respond similarly to the various diet prescriptions. Although specific dietary recommendations have been drawn up for T2DM, which are continuously being revised 87 , individuals without T2DM have largely been treated by both clinicians and researchers alike as a homogeneous group. Nevertheless, variation in baseline glycaemic control in people with overweight and obesity but without T2DM, such as the presence of normoglycaemia or prediabetes, might lead to variable weight loss success and metabolic responses to dietary treatment 46 . In the USA, the prevalence of prediabetes has been progressively climbing, from 20% of the adult population in 2000 to 37% in 2012, and this figure is projected to rise to 40% in 2030 (ref. 88 ) . People with prediabetes have a considerably increased risk of T2DM 88 ; however, weight loss induced by lifestyle modification can decrease this risk by ~50% 81, 89 . This has been shown consistently in major randomized studies such as the US 90 and Finnish 91 diabetes prevention trials, which included 500-3,250 individuals with prediabetes and achieved 5-7% weight loss with a combination of dietary restriction and increased physical activity (150-210 min/week) over ~3 years. A similar reduction in the risk of T2DM was found in the Chinese Da Qing Diabetes Prevention study, which achieved only mild weight loss (2-3 kg) and focused mostly on increasing physical activity for 6 years 92 . Remarkably, the beneficial effects of lifestyle modification to prevent or delay T2DM can persist for an impressive 14 years after the active intervention 93 . Therefore, helping the growing number of patients with prediabetes lose weight (or prevent further weight gain) can be an effective strategy for reducing overall rates of T2DM.

A review from 2018 identified a considerable number of studies that investigated preintervention measures of glycaemia and insulinaemia to determine whether they could be useful biomarkers to predict weight loss among individuals with normoglycaemia and prediabetes following specific diets 46 . To a greater extent than insulin, the level of baseline fasting glucose was found to be a potent prognostic marker of weight loss success. Furthermore, evidence suggested that, among participants with prediabetes, the overall macronutrient composition of the diet was of little importance; however, the quality of dietary carbohydrate was extremely important for weight loss and weight loss maintenance 46 .

In the Supermarket Intervention study (SHOPUS, Denmark), participants with increased waist circumference (≥80 cm for women and ≥94 cm for men) were randomized either to the New Nordic Diet or the Average Danish Diet for 6 months 94 . The New Nordic Diet is based on the consumption of high-quality carbohydrates and generally comprises local and minimally processed foods (for example, berries, cabbages, root vegetables, legumes, potatoes, fresh herbs, wild plants and mushrooms, nuts, whole grains, meats from livestock and game, fish and shellfish, and seaweed), whereas the Average Danish Diet is similar to a Western control diet and comprises foods such as refined grains including pasta and rice, meat, dairy and cheese, sugary products, convenience foods and, to a lesser extent, low-fibre vegetables and imported fruit 94 . Participants were instructed to eat both diets ad libitum; to increase adherence, cookbooks and all foods were provided free of charge at a specially designed supermarket at the University of Copenhagen, and barcodes were scanned to ensure foods were consumed according to the randomization group. When stratifying by baseline fasting plasma glucose concentrations, we found that individuals with prediabetes lost 6.0 kg more on the New Nordic Diet than on the Average Danish Diet, whereas normoglycaemic individuals lost only 2.2 kg more 95 . Using a novel statistical approach for estimating truly individualized treatment effects, we found that the New Nordic Diet produces a 3.0-kg greater weight loss than the Average Danish Diet for every 1 mmol/l increase in baseline fasting plasma glucose concentration 96 (fig. 5a, b ). These findings suggest the importance of baseline glycaemic control for weight loss success.

In the Monounsaturated Fatty Acids in Obesity study (MUFOBES, Denmark), participants with overweight and obesity initially lost ~12 kg on a low-calorie diet and were subsequently randomized to one of three different ad libitum diets for 6 months 97 : a high-monounsaturated fat diet; a low-fat (20-30% of total energy intake) high-fibre (>30 g/10 MJ) diet similar to the New Nordic Diet; or the Average Danish Diet. Again, all foods were provided free of charge at a specially designed supermarket. When participants were stratified according to initial fasting plasma glucose levels, those with prediabetes did not regain any weight on the New Nordic-like Diet whereas those on the Average Danish Diet regained 4.2 kg, resulting in lower weight regain on the former diet than the latter (-4.2 kg, 95% CI -6.8 to -1.6, P = 0.002), whereas no such difference was observed among normoglycaemic individuals, who regained 2.1-2.5 kg on both diets 98 . Using the aforementioned novel statistical approach 96 , we demonstrated that the New Nordic-like Diet produces a 7.3-kg smaller weight regain than the Average Danish Diet for every 1 mmol/l increase in baseline fasting plasma glucose concentration (fig. 5c, d ), again highlighting the potential importance of baseline glycaemia in the body weight response to dietary treatment. In three separate analyses (one for each of the SHOPUS 94 , MUFOBES 97 and DIOGENES 99 trials), differences in changes in body weight from baseline to 6 months were estimated using a linear mixed model, which included fasting plasma glucose-by-diet interactions, as well as age and sex (and low-calorie diet in MUFOBES and DIOGENES) as fixed effects and subject-specific random effects 96 . For SHOPUS, weight changes after 6 months on the New Nordic Diet (NND) or the Average Danish Diet (ADD) in relationship to baseline fasting glucose (part a) were used to calculate the difference between diets (part b). The slope for the difference between the NND and the ADD was 3.0 kg per mmol/l (95% CI 1.2 to 4.8 kg per mmol/l, P = 0.001) (ADD 0.6, 95% CI -0.9 to 2.2, P = 0.43; NND -2.4, 95% CI -1.5 to -3.3, P < 0.001). For MUFOBES, weight changes after an initial period of diet-induced weight loss followed by 6 months on the NND or the ADD in relationship to baseline fasting glucose (part c) were used to calculate the difference between diets (part d). The slope for the difference between the NND and ADD was 7.3 kg per mmol/l (95% CI 3.2 to 11.4 kg per mmol/l, P < 0.001) (ADD 4.9, 95% CI 1.8 to 8.1, P = 0.002; NND -2.3, 95% CI -4.9 to 0.2, P = 0.073). For DIOGENES, weight changes after an initial period of diet-induced weight loss followed by 6 months on the lowest glycaemic load (LGL) diet or the highest glycaemic load (HGL) diet in relationship to baseline fasting glucose (part e) were used to calculate the difference between diets (part f). The slope for the difference between the LGL diet and the HGL diet was 1.8 kg per mmol/l (95% CI 0.1 to 3.5 kg per mmol/l, P = 0.038) (HGL 1.6, 95% CI 0.2 to 2.9, P = 0.020; LGL -0.2, 95% CI -1.3 to 0.8, P = 0.67).

In the pan-European Diet, Obesity, and Genes (DIOGENES) trial, individuals with overweight and obesity achieved an initial weight loss of ~11 kg by consuming a low-calorie diet for 2 months and were then randomized to one of five ad libitum diets, which differed in glycaemic index and protein content for 6 months 99 . Overall, participants who were assigned to the highest glycaemic load diet (that is, high glycaemic index and low protein) regained 1.9 kg more than those randomized to the lowest glycaemic load diet (that is, low glycaemic index and high protein) 99 . When reanalysing the results, we found that participants with prediabetes regained 5.8 kg more (95% CI 3.3 to 8.3 kg, P < 0.001) on the highest glycaemic load diet than those on the lowest glycaemic load diet, whereas normoglycaemic individuals regained only 1.4 kg more (95% CI 0.5 to 2.4 kg, P = 0.003), resulting in a 4.4-kg difference (95% CI 1.8 to 7.0 kg, P = 0.001) in the responsiveness to the diets between glycaemic groups 95 . As above, we demonstrated that the lowest glycaemic diet produces 1.8-kg smaller weight regain than the highest glycaemic load diet for every 1 mmol/l increase in baseline fasting plasma glucose concentration (fig. 5e, f ). The two low glycaemic index diets in the DIOGENES trial (with low or high protein content) produced a 1.2-kg (95% CI 0.3 to 2.2 kg, P = 0.01) smaller weight regain for every 1 mmol/l increase in baseline fasting plasma glucose concentration compared with the two high glycaemic index diets (with low or high protein content). By contrast, no significant differences were found between the two high-protein and the two low-protein diets (-0.4 kg, 95% CI -1.3 to 0.6 kg, P = 0.48). Overall, these findings suggest an interaction between baseline glycaemic control and the amount and quality of dietary carbohydrate for optimal weight loss maintenance.

These observations are also in line with the results from a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial of a novel hydrogel that was designed to mimic the viscoelastic properties of leafy vegetables (that is, cellulosic-based composition and mechanical properties) 100 . Patients with overweight and obesity were prescribed a hypocaloric diet of 300 kcal per day below their calculated energy requirements and were randomized to hydrogel or placebo for 24 weeks. Compared with patients treated with placebo, those treated with the hydrogel lost 2.1% more of their baseline weight (P = 0.0007) and had two times greater odds of achieving ≥10% weight loss (P = 0.0107). Notably, among the subgroup of patients with prediabetes (defined according to fasting plasma glucose levels at baseline), the odds of achieving ≥10% weight loss were approximately six times greater in the hydrogel group than in the placebo group (P = 0.0071) 100 .

Collectively, these observations suggest that patients with prediabetes might experience greater weight loss and avoid or minimize weight regain, even without being prescribed a calorie-restricted diet, when they follow an ad libitum diet that includes lowglycaemic index carbohydrate and increased amounts of dietary fibre. These observations, albeit interesting, have been produced by post-hoc analyses of data from larger trials; therefore, they should be interpreted with caution, particularly owing to the presence of many confounding factors and the absence of randomized controlled studies. In our statistical models, we adjusted for age, sex and baseline body weight, as these parameters differed or tended to differ among groups that were stratified by baseline glycaemia. Residual confounding cannot be excluded; however, these findings 95, 96, 98 could not be explained by differences in baseline carbohydrate or fibre intakes as these were not different between normoglycaemic participants and those with prediabetes. All the reanalysed trials were double-blinded with respect to the glycaemic status of the participants, and identified differences in dietary responsiveness therefore cannot have been influenced by researcher bias. Finally, the available measures in the three studies reanalysed indicate that fasting insulin and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, insulin secretion indexes, glucose tolerance (2-h glucose concentration measured by a standard oral glucose tolerance test) and long-term glycaemic control (HbA 1c ) are less predictive of weight loss success than fasting glucose levels. To move this field forward, it is important to conduct randomized controlled trials of adequate size and duration, in which individuals with different levels of baseline glycaemic control are randomly assigned to different types of diets for both weight loss and weight maintenance.

A substantial dietary energy restriction has been proven to be a very successful method of producing rapid and major weight loss in individuals with overweight and obesity with T2DM. The achievement of weight loss in excess of 10-15 kg is key for T2DM remission; however, other factors including carbohydrate restriction and increased physical activity might help maximize the achieved metabolic benefits. Future studies should address this possibility in a systematic way. For example, exercise training is a potent intervention that improves glucose homeostasis and could also help in the control of body weight, but its contribution to T2DM remission within a comprehensive lifestyle modification programme is largely unexplored. Unfortunately, long-term maintenance of weight loss has been a major challenge owing to hunger and a lack of sufficient postprandial satiety signals, which contribute to decreasing adherence to the diet prescription over time [101] [102] [103] . This lack of adherence is probably a main reason for the generally low effectiveness observed when instructing patients to substantially alter their diet (for example, by replacing carbohydrate with fat or protein) for ≥1 year without providing the whole diet itself or at least some key food pro ducts. This observation calls for more studies to better understand factors that foster long-term adherence.

Comparisons between low-fat and low-carbohydrate diets have not led to any consistent results in unselected populations with obesity; however, retrospective analyses 95, 96, 98 from randomized controlled trials 94, 97, 99 have demonstrated the potential for much greater success in achieving satiety and body weight control among people with prediabetes, and probably also in those with T2DM, when using a personalized, precision dietary management approach based on glucose-related metabolic traits (that is, fasting glucose levels). The effectiveness of this approach for selecting the optimal dietary treatment for weight loss and metabolic improvements in patients with prediabetes and T2DM needs to be further tested in prospective randomized clinical trials before translation of these exciting new findings into clinical practice.
