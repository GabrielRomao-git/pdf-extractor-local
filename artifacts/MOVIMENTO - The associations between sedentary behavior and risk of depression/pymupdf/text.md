Abstract
Background  Depression is a prevalent mental health disorder affecting millions of people worldwide, imposing a 
significant economic burden on society. Despite the progress in treatment, many individuals with depression still face 
challenges in accessing appropriate care. Therefore, effectively preventing depression has become an area of focus. 
The purpose of this study is to explore the impact of sedentary behaviour and varying dose-response relationships on 
the risk of depression.
Methods  A systematic search of relevant studies published up to 15 August 2024 was performed using the 
PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases. We selected original studies that reported a relationship between 
sedentary behaviour and the risk of depression. Two authors used pre-filled forms to independently extract the trial 
characteristics and intervention details. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 
(PRISMA) guidelines were followed, and a random effects analysis was conducted. Clinical outcomes were assessed 
according to odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The quality of the included studies was evaluated 
using the Eight-component Rating scale and the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool.
Results  Twenty-five studies involving 252,503 participants were included. Compared with participants with less 
sedentary behaviour, those with more sedentary behaviour had a significantly increased risk of depression (OR 1.35 
[95% CI 1.20–1.52], p < 0.001; I2 = 83.3%, p < 0.001). Furthermore, we found that among participants with sedentary 
behaviour, those aged 16–20 had the highest risk of depression (OR 1.69, p < 0.001), followed by those under the age 
of 16 (OR 1.43, p < 0.001) and those aged 20–40 (OR 1.05, p = 0.032). In contrast, participants > 40 years showed no 
significant difference (OR 1.14, p = 0.073). Participants from developed countries had a lower risk of depression than 
the risk in those from developing countries. Lastly, sedentary behaviour of varying intensities was associated with a 
higher risk of depression.

Background
Depression is widely recognised as one of the most 
pressing mental health issues. Over the past 30 years, 
the number of global depression cases has increased by 
nearly 50%, with more than 264 million people affected 
across all age groups [1, 2]. The main characteristic of 
depression is a persistent ‘low mood’, accompanied by 
cognitive and physical changes that disrupt normal func­
tioning of an individual and can even lead to suicide [2–
4]. Additionally, depression often has a high recurrence 
rate, with the American Psychiatric Association estimat­
ing a relapse rate as high as 75–90% [5, 6]. Data from 
the World Health Organization show that depression 
is one of the leading causes of mental and physical dis­
ability worldwide, significantly impacting social and eco­
nomic well-being [7]. Owing to the unpredictable course, 
complex progression, and variable responses associated 
with depression, diagnosis and treatment in clinical set­
tings present major challenges [8, 9]. Therefore, how to 
effectively prevent or reduce the risk of depression has 
become a question worth considering.
With technological advancements, computer and 
smartphone use has become increasingly widespread, 
and the number of people engaged in related work has 
grown substantially [10, 11]. Moreover, screen time, 
including watching television, using computers, and play­
ing video games, is increasing among adolescents and 
adults, becoming a significant part of daily life and the 
most common form of sedentary behavior [12]. Seden­
tary behaviour refers to activities that require minimal 
physical movement and have an energy expenditure simi­
lar to that of being at rest [13]. Sedentary behaviour can 
greatly increase the risk of obesity and cardiovascular 
diseases, and may also be associated with some psycho­
logical disorders [14–16]. However, whether sedentary 
behaviour increases the risk of depression requires fur­
ther clarification.
Huang et al. indicated in their meta-analysis that psy­
chologically passive sedentary behavior may increase 
the risk of depression [17]. Sedentary behaviors, such as 
using a computer, can hinder face-to-face interactions 
among people, leading to reduced social engagement and 
an increased likelihood of developing depression [18]. In 
addition, Zhou et al. and Jiang et al. respectively explored 
the impact of sedentary behavior on depression in adult 
and elderly populations [19, 20]. However, there is cur­
rently a lack of research on young or adolescent popu­
lations. Adolescents, in particular, are often engaged in 
sedentary behaviors such as watching television or using 
smartphones [21]. Therefore, this study conducts a more 
detailed age stratification to investigate the impact of 
sedentary behavior on depression, in the hope of provid­
ing a basis for future effective prevention of depression.
It is currently unclear whether there is a link between 
sedentary behavior and the risk of depression. Pooling the 
existing evidence, we conducted a meta-analysis to the 
relationship between sedentary behaviour and the risk of 
depression. Subgroup analyses were also conducted for 
various countries, patient ages, sample sizes, and intensi­
ties of sedentary time to investigate the impact of differ­
ent dose-response relationships on the risk of depression.
Materials and methods
This study was conducted in accordance with the Pre­
ferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) [22] and registered in the 
International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews 
(PROSPERO) (registration number: CRD42024583157).
Search strategy
Two authors (HDH and HT) systematically and indepen­
dently searched for relevant literature using the PubMed, 
Web of Science, and Embase databases up to 15 August 
2024. The search strategy included the terms ‘sedentary 
behavior*’ OR ‘sedentary lifestyle’ OR ‘physical inactivity’ 
OR ‘lack of physical activity’ OR ‘sedentary time*’, AND 
‘depression’ OR ‘depressive symptom’ OR ‘emotional 
depression’ OR ‘depressive’ OR ‘dysthymia’ OR ‘mental 
illness’, combined with ‘Clinical Trial’. The reference lists 
of the included studies were also within the scope of our 
screening.
Screening criteria
The risk of depression was defined as a clinical diagnosis 
of depression, including major depressive disorder (Sin­
gle/recurrent depressive episodes with ICD-10 codes F32 
or F33, or the criteria for MDD in DSM-5) and mood dis­
orders (excluding bipolar disorder), or the possibility of 
developing or experiencing subclinical depressive symp­
toms. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) studies 
investigating the impact of sedentary behaviour or screen 
time on depression; (2) results quantified with odds 
ratios (ORs), mean differences (MDs), or standardised 
mean differences (SMDs), accompanied by the relevant 
95% confidence intervals (CIs); (3) observational studies 
or randomised controlled trials; (4) The number of MDD 
Conclusions  Sedentary behaviour greatly increases the risk of depression. Participants under the age of 20 were 
at a higher risk of developing depression owing to sedentary behaviour. Appropriate exercise can be effective for 
preventing depression.

episodes or treatment response is not restricted; and (5) 
age of participants > 10 years. The exclusion criteria were 
as follows: (1) studies involving non-human research; (2) 
studies published in a language other than English; (3) 
studies involving other non-depressive mood disorders, 
such as bipolar disorder F31, dysthymia F34.1, psychotic 
depression, and organic affective disorders; and (4) stud­
ies in the form of reviews, meta-analyses, conference 
abstracts, letters, or editorials.
Data extraction
Two authors (HDH and HT) independently extracted 
data, and disagreements were resolved by consulting a 
third researcher. The data extracted from each selected 
study included the first author, year of publication, coun­
try, age (years), sample size, depression indicator, sed­
entary behaviour indicator, categories (intensities of 
sedentary behaviour), study design, quality score, and 
outcome(s) (including OR/MD/SMD, 95% CI).
Evaluation of study quality
A refined Eight-component Rating scale was used to 
assess the methodological rigour of the included studies 
[23]. The scale encompasses six key domains: selection 
bias; study design, such as cross-sectional or cohort stud­
ies; control of confounding factors including age and sex; 
methods of data collection; data extraction processes; 
and analytical techniques. Each domain was assigned 
a qualitative rating (weak, moderate, or strong). Upon 
completing the assessment of all domains, an aggregate 
rating was assigned to each study: weak if two or more 
domains were deemed weak; moderate if fewer than 
three domains were strong and no more than one was 
weak; or strong if three or more domains were strong and 
one or none was weak. Furthermore, the Cochrane Risk 
of Bias tool [24] was used to evaluate randomised con­
trolled trials, addressing potential biases including selec­
tion, reporting, performance, detection, attrition, and 
other considerations. Each aspect was classified as high 
risk, low risk, or unclear. The studies were subsequently 
categorised into three tiers of quality: weak if three or 
more aspects were at low or unclear risk, moderate for all 
other cases not classified as strong or weak, and strong if 
no more than one aspect was at low or unclear risk.
Data analysis
The ORs/MDs and corresponding 95% CIs were used 
to assess the relationship between sedentary behaviour 
and depression. Where possible, adjusted effect sizes 
were utilised. A random effects model was employed for 
the meta-analysis of the effect sizes (OR) and the corre­
sponding 95% CI using Review Manager version 5.4 (R 
Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) 
and Stata version 15 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, 
TX, USA) [25].
Furthermore, we also calculated the prediction inter­
vals for the relevant ORs [26], using the following for­
mula: Prediction Intervals = ln(ORs)±(Z0.975×SE×√2);SE = 
{ln(upper) − ln(lower)}/ (2×Z0.975); Z0.975 ≈ 1.96.​ 
Additionally, stratified subgroup analyses were con­
ducted based on sex, country (developed, developing), 
age (< 16, 16–20, 20–40, > 40), intensity of sedentary 
behaviour (> 4  h/day, ≤ 4  h/day), and sample size. The 
heterogeneity of the results was assessed using the I2 sta­
tistic, with I2 > 50% indicating significant heterogeneity 
[25]. Publication bias was evaluated using funnel plots, 
Egger’s, and Begg’s tests [27]. Finally, aside from hetero­
geneity, a p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statis­
tically significant.
Results
Initially, 1,894 relevant studies were identified, with 
an additional 10 studies included from the reference 
lists. After excluding 853 duplicate studies, 1,006 irrel­
evant studies were excluded by screening the abstracts 
and titles, leaving 45 studies for full-text assessment. 
Per the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 20 studies were 
excluded, including reviews, meta-analyses, or case 
reports (n = 4), studies with no pertinent results reported 
(n = 9), those with no depression events described (n = 4), 
and those whose full texts were unavailable (n = 3). A 
total of 25 studies [28–52] were ultimately included in 
this analysis (Fig. 1).
Study characteristics
The 25 included studies comprised 252,503 participants 
(Table  1). Among the studies, 15 were cross-sectional 
studies, 8 were cohort studies, and 2 were randomised 
controlled trials. After assessing the quality of the lit­
erature, 60% of the studies were of strong quality, 28% 
were of moderate quality, and 12% were of weak quality. 
Regarding the sample sizes, 7 studies included more than 
5,000 participants, whereas 18 included 5,000 or fewer 
participants (Table 1).
Sedentary behavior and risk of depression
Compared with participants with less sedentary behav­
iour time, those with longer sedentary behaviour time 
had a significantly increased risk of depression (OR 
1.35 [95% CI 1.20–1.52], p < 0.001; Prediction Interval: 
1.14–1.60), despite significant heterogeneity (I2 = 83.3%, 
p < 0.001) (Fig.  2). Moreover, a randomised controlled 
study [29] indicated that for each additional hour of 
social media usage, the depression symptom score 
increased by 0.64 units (95% CI 0.48–0.81; Prediction 
Interval:0.43–0.90) (Table 1).

Subgroup analysis
To further explore the potential sources of heterogeneity, 
subgroup analyses were conducted based on sex, country 
(developed, developing), age (< 16, 16–20, 20–40, > 40), 
intensity of sedentary behaviour (> 4  h/day, ≤ 4  h/day), 
and sample sizes (> 5,000, ≤ 5,000). The results revealed 
that compared to all participants, female participants 
(OR 1.43 [95% CI 0.94–2.18], p = 0.09) did not show a 
significantly higher risk of depression due to sedentary 
behaviour (Table 2). As shown in Table 2, we found that 
participants from developed countries (OR 1.13 [95% 
CI 1.04–1.23], p = 0.003) who engaged in longer peri­
ods of sedentary behaviour had a lower risk of depres­
sion compared with that of individuals from developing 
countries (OR 1.50 [95% CI 1.18–1.91], p = 0.001). Both 
analyses exhibited significant heterogeneity (developed 
countries, I2 = 95.4%, p < 0.001; developing countries, 
I2 = 63.2, p = 0.001). Furthermore, we found that the risk 
of depression associated with sedentary behaviour var­
ied across age groups. Compared with those with shorter 
sedentary behavior times, participants aged 16–20 
years had the highest risk (OR 1.69 [95% CI 1.47–1.93], 
p < 0.001; I2 = 7.8%, p = 0.338), followed by those under 
16 (OR 1.43 [95% CI 1.37–1.72], p < 0.001; I2 = 28.8%, 
p = 0.238) and those 20–40 (OR 1.05 [95% CI 1.00–1.10], 
p = 0.032; I2 = 0%, p = 0.684). Participants over 40 did not 
show significant differences (OR 1.14 [95% CI 0.99–1.31], 
p = 0.073; I2 = 65.3%, p = 0.013) (Table 2).
Regarding sedentary behaviour time, 12 studies 
used > 4 h/day as the reference group, with a pooled OR 
of 1.25 (95% CI 1.12–1.39; p < 0.001), and high heteroge­
neity (I2 = 90.9%). Eight studies used ≤ 4 h/day as the refer­
ence group, with a pooled OR of 1.36 (95% CI 1.16–1.60; 
p < 0.001), and high heterogeneity (I2 = 81.8%) (Table  2). 
Considering whether the sample size might influence 
the results, seven studies with a sample size > 5,000 had 
a pooled OR of 1.36 (95% CI 1.11–1.61; p = 0.004), with 
high heterogeneity (I2 = 91.9%). Seventeen studies with 
a sample size ≤ 5,000 had a pooled OR of 1.26 (95% CI 
1.15–1.38; p < 0.001), with high heterogeneity (I2 = 84.5%) 
(Table 2).
Publication bias
A funnel plot was used to assess publication bias. The 
effect size OR did not exhibit clear symmetry, and some 
studies fell outside the funnel plot (Supplementary

Fig. 1). Therefore, the possibility of publication bias can­
not be disregarded. Egger’s (p = 0.27) and Begg’s (p = 0.91) 
tests were used to verify publication bias. The results 
indicated no significant publication bias (Supplementary 
Fig. 2).
Sensitivity analysis
After adjustments, the sensitivity analysis of the rela­
tionship between sedentary behaviour and depression 
revealed that no study significantly impacted the final 
pooled OR value (Supplementary Fig. 3).
Discussion
In this study, we investigated the impact of sedentary 
behaviour on the risk of depression under various fac­
tors. We found that participants under the age of 20 
had a greater risk of developing depression due to sed­
entary behaviour compared with that in other groups. 
This study also found that sedentary behaviour times of 
> 4 h/day or ≤ 4 h/day pose a higher risk of depression for 
participants.
Several mechanistic studies have attempted to explain 
the relationship between sedentary behaviour and the 
risk of depression. Luban et al. have proposed a series 
of related studies on neurobiological, psychosocial, and 
behavioural mechanisms [53]. Research indicates that 
participation in physical activity enhances cognitive 
and mental health by altering the structure and func­
tional composition of the brain [54]. Reducing sedentary 
behavior may be beneficial for reducing negative emo­
tions [55]. Additionally, sedentary behaviour, accompa­
nied by a reduction in activity levels, leads to changes in 
mental health outcomes that are mediated by alterations 
in related behaviours, particularly those affecting sleep 
duration and quality [56]. Interestingly, studies sug­
gest that decreased brain-derived neurotrophic factor 
(BDNF) levels are associated with an increased risk of 
depression [57, 58]. BDNF is a key molecule that regu­
lates neuroplasticity; it can promote neuronal growth, 
synaptic formation, and functional maintenance; and 
plays a crucial role in emotional regulation and cognitive 
function repair [59]. A decline in BDNF levels may lead 
to dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal 
axis, increasing cortisol release, which further impairs 
neuronal function and exacerbates depressive symptoms 
[60]. In contrast, prolonged sedentary behavior can dis­
rupt the levels of BDNF, leading to issues such as central 
nervous system arousal disorders and sleep disturbances 
[61, 62]. Moreover, sedentary behaviour has also been 
shown to be associated with obesity [63]. The results of 
this study indicated that participants with longer sed­
entary behaviour times had a significantly higher risk of 
depression than the risk in those with shorter sedentary 
behaviour times (OR 1.35, p < 0.001). Therefore, effec­
tively avoiding sedentary behaviour is a strategy worth 
considering.
Wang et al. and Huang et al. [17] only included cohort, 
cross-sectional, or prospective studies in their meta-
analysis. In this study, we expanded the scope to include 
randomised controlled trials, thereby increasing the reli­
ability of our results. Notably, compared with the stud­
ies by Zhou et al. [19] and Jiang et al. [20], we conducted 
a more detailed stratification of the participants’ ages. 
We found that participants under the age of 20 were at 
a greater risk of developing depression due to sedentary 
behaviour. Hoare et al. [64] and Rodriguez-Ayllon et al.

[55] demonstrated in their studies a significant positive 
correlation between sedentary behaviour and depressive 
symptoms in adolescents. This result is consistent with 
the findings of the present study. Furthermore, the asso­
ciation between sedentary behaviour and depression may 
be bidirectional. Therefore, more experiments are needed 
to explore the link between sedentary behaviour and 
depression and clarify their causal relationship.
In the subgroup analysis, we found that, regarding sed­
entary behaviour, participants from developed countries 
have a lower risk of depression compared with the risk 
of those from developing countries. This may be associ­
ated with the medical systems or mental health resources 
available in these countries. Herrman et al. [65] indicated 
that the types and prevalence of depressive symptoms 
and early signs varied greatly across different cultures 
and contexts. Additionally, we found that long and short 
durations of sedentary behaviour can greatly increase the 
risk of depression (> 4 h/day: OR 1.25 95% CI 1.12–1.39; 
≤ 4  h/day: OR 1.36 95% CI 1.16–1.60). Appropriately 
increasing physical activity can help reduce the occur­
rence of depression and the risk of obesity and cardio­
vascular diseases [15, 16]. Given that depression is a 
common but under-recognized illness, further research 
is necessary on the risk of depression and the impact of 
different types of sedentary behaviours such as watching 
television, using computers and the internet for work, 
and playing video games. This can better facilitate the 
prevention of depression.
Furthermore, we found that the risk of depression as 
it relates to sedentary behavior varied across age groups. 
The highest risk was observed in individuals aged 16–20 
years, followed by those under 16, those over 40, and 
those 20–40. The link between sedentary behaviour and 
depression in older adults is associated with the type of 
sedentary activity, and mentally active sedentary behav­
iours may reduce the risk of depression [20]. Adolescents 
often have relatively long screen times, with certain sed­
entary behaviours (such as watching TV or using smart­
phones) significantly increasing the risk of depression in 
individuals under 20 [21].
The heterogeneity in this study was more pronounced 
in the subgroup analysis. The I² statistic fluctuated partic­
ularly significantly in groups stratified by age and country. 
However, neither the publication bias assessment nor the 
sensitivity analysis indicated that any single study signifi­
cantly influenced the final pooled ORs value. This may be 
related to the establishment of depression measurement 
criteria. Studies using screening tools (such as the PHQ-
9) may include more individuals with mild or subclinical 
symptoms, thereby magnifying the association between 
sedentary behavior and depression. In addition, the cut­
off values of different scales (such as the CES-D) may also 
affect the consistency of the results. Future studies need 
to adopt a consistent definition of sedentary behavior and 
the gold standard for depression diagnosis to reduce the 
heterogeneity of studies.
This study has certain limitations. First, although ran­
domised controlled trials were included, the number 
of studies was relatively small, with the majority being 
cross-sectional and cohort studies. This is highly unfa­
vourable for exploring the causal relationship between 
sedentary behaviour and depression. Second, regarding 
the indicators of sedentary behaviour, most studies used 
self-reported time, which might have involved certain 
memory biases and subjectivity. Finally, some uncon­
trollable factors could have also affected the results. For 
instance, some participants might have underreported 
their conditions owing to the stigma associated with 
mental illness, leading to potential biases. Therefore, 
multicentre, randomised controlled trials should be con­
ducted in the future.
Conclusion
We found that sedentary behaviour significantly 
increases the risk of depression, especially in individuals 
under the age of 20. Engaging in appropriate exercise and 
reducing sedentary behaviour can be beneficial to pre­
vent depression.
