Abstract. Hu FB. Diet strategies for promoting
healthy aging and longevity: An epidemiological
perspective. J Intern Med. 2024;295:508–31.

In recent decades, global life expectancies have
risen signiﬁcantly, accompanied by a marked
increase in chronic diseases and population
aging. This narrative review aims to summarize
recent ﬁndings on the dietary factors inﬂuenc-
ing chronic diseases and longevity, primarily from
large cohort studies. First, maintaining a healthy
weight throughout life is pivotal for healthy aging
and longevity, mirroring the beneﬁts of lifelong,
moderate calorie restriction in today’s obesogenic
food environment. Second, the speciﬁc types or
food sources of dietary fat, protein, and carbohy-
drates are more important in inﬂuencing chronic
disease risk and mortality than their quantity.
Third, some traditional diets (e.g., the Mediter-
ranean, Nordic, and Okinawa) and contemporary
dietary patterns, such as healthy plant-based diet
index, the DASH (dietary approaches to stop hyper-
tension) diet, and alternate healthy eating index,
have been associated with lower mortality and

healthy longevity. These patterns share many com-
mon components (e.g., a predominance of nutrient-
rich plant foods; limited red and processed meats;
culinary herbs and spices prevalent in global
cuisines) while embracing distinct elements from
different cultures. Fourth, combining a healthy diet
with other lifestyle factors could extend disease-
free life expectancies by 8–10 years. While adhering
to core principles of healthy diets, it is crucial to
adapt dietary recommendations to individual pref-
erences and cultures as well as nutritional needs of
aging populations. Public health strategies should
aim to create a healthier food environment where
nutritious options are readily accessible, espe-
cially in public institutions and care facilities for
the elderly. Although further mechanistic stud-
ies and human trials are needed to better under-
stand molecular effects of diet on aging, there is
a pressing need to establish and maintain long-
term cohorts studying diet and aging in culturally
diverse populations.

Introduction

In recent decades,
life expectancy around the
world has shown a remarkable increase, due to
reduction in infant mortality and improvements in
health care, nutrition, and public health measures
[1]. However, longer life expectancies, along with
declining birth rates, have led to a greater propor-
tion of elderly individuals in many populations.
In the meantime, there has been a rapid increase
in the prevalence of chronic diseases, including
diabetes, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), cancer,
dementia, and other age-related conditions [2].

Many of these diseases are related to suboptimal
diet and lifestyles. Indeed, poor diet is recognized
as a leading contributor to the global burden of
diseases, including deaths and disability-adjusted
life years (DALYs); it was estimated that world-
wide, 11 million premature deaths and 255 million
DALYs per year were attributable to unhealthy
dietary factors including high sodium and trans
fat, and low fruits, vegetables, nuts, and omega-3
fatty acids [3].

The concept of “healthy longevity” has garnered
much attention in recent years because it is

focused on not only increasing the overall
life
expectancy or life span of individuals but also on
increasing the length of life free from major chronic
diseases, often referred to as the “healthspan” [4].
The National Academy of Medicine deﬁned healthy
longevity as “years of good health approach the bio-
logical life span, with physical, cognitive, and social
functioning that enable well-being” [5]. The deﬁni-
tion underscores a preventive approach to health
and well-being through diet and lifestyle modiﬁca-
tions. This concept is also closely linked to healthy
aging, which refers to maintenance of physical,
mental, and cognitive health as individuals grow
older [6], while preventing or delaying the onset of
frailty in elderly individuals [7].

This narrative review aims to summarize recent
ﬁndings on the dietary factors inﬂuencing chronic
diseases and longevity, primarily from large cohort
studies. Speciﬁcally, we highlight ﬁndings from
two large cohort studies: the Nurses’ Health Study
(NHS) and Health Professionals’ Follow-up Study
(HPFS), which are among the largest and longest
running cohort studies on diet and health in
the world [8–10]. Besides large sample sizes, a
long duration of follow-up spanning more than
three decades, and high rates of follow-up (>90%),
detailed data on diet and lifestyle factors have
been collected every 2–4 years. The repeated mea-
sures of diet are particularly useful in reducing
measurement errors stemming from self-reported
diets and representing long-term dietary habits [9].
Because large randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of
diet and longevity are typically not feasible due to
lack of long-term adherence and cost considera-
tions, observational data derived from high-quality
cohorts—combined with insights from small RCTs
in humans and experimental data from animal
studies—can substantially enhance our under-
standing of the role of diet in preventing chronic
diseases and reducing premature deaths, which
can help to formulate evidence-based nutritional
strategies to support healthy longevity in aging
populations [11].

Calorie restriction and energy balance

Calorie restriction has been widely considered a
promising approach to fostering long-term health
and longevity [12]. In various organisms,
from
yeast to mammals, calorie restriction (with a sig-
niﬁcant reduction in food and caloric intake below
ad libitum levels without causing malnutrition)
has been found to be effective in increasing life

span and delaying the onset of age-related diseases
[13]. The molecular pathways underlying these
beneﬁts are complex and multifaceted, including
reduced insulin and Insulin Growth Factor-1
(IGF-1) signaling, inhibiting the mechanistic tar-
get of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, activation of
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and sirtuins
1 (SIRT1), upregulation of the NAD+ pathway
and autophagy, and reducing inﬂammation and
oxidative stress [14, 15].

However, the effects of sustained calorie restric-
tion over the long-term in humans are much more
challenging to study, especially in the context
of the obesogenic food environment [16]. In the
longest caloric reduction trial among nonobese
individuals,
the Comprehensive Assessment of
Long-term Effects of Reducing Intake of Energy
(CALERIE) trial demonstrated that participants
in the calorie restriction group achieved approxi-
mately 12% calorie reduction and a sustained 10%
weight loss compared to the control group over 2
years, accompanied by signiﬁcant improvement
in blood lipids, blood pressure, insulin sensitivity,
and pro-inﬂammatory cytokines [17]. Despite
these promising ﬁndings, it is difﬁcult to extrap-
olate the short-term cardiometabolic beneﬁts to
long-term chronic disease risk reduction and
increased longevity due to the study’s relatively
short duration and small sample size.

A major challenge in the practical implementation
of calorie restriction lies in the accurate track-
ing of daily caloric intake, energy expenditure,
and long-term adherence to a calorie-restricted
diet. In epidemiologic studies, body weight tra-
jectories can be used as a marker of long-term
energy balance across different stages of
life.
Using data from NHS and HPFS, we assessed
body shape trajectories in early and middle life in
relation to subsequent mortality risk [18]. Using
a statistical modeling approach, ﬁve distinct tra-
jectories of body shape from age 5 to 50 were
identiﬁed:
lean-moderate/increase,
lean-marked/increase, medium-stable/increase,
and heavy-stable/increase. To minimize confound-
ing by smoking, the primary analyses were limited
to never smokers. Compared to the lean-stable
group, the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio for
death from any cause was 1.08 (95% conﬁdence
interval 1.02–1.14) for women and 0.95 (0.88–1.03)
for men in the lean-moderate/increase group, 1.43
(1.33–1.54) for women and 1.11 (1.02–1.20) for
men in the lean-marked/increase group, 1.04

(0.97–1.12) for women and 1.01 (0.94–1.09) for
men in the medium-stable/increase group, and
1.64 (1.49–1.81) for women and 1.19 (1.08–1.32)
for men in the heavy-stable/increase group. This
study provides evidence to support the beneﬁts on
longevity of maintaining a stable-lean body shape
throughout life. Similarly, women and men who
maintained a lean body shape across different
life stages had the lowest risk of type 2 diabetes
and CVD, whereas those who had substantially
increased body adiposity had the highest risk of
developing these diseases [19].

In further analyses, even a modest amount of
weight gain (e.g., 5 kg) during young and middle
adulthood (18–55 years) was associated with a sig-
niﬁcantly elevated risk of developing type 2 dia-
betes (by 30%), hypertension (by 14%), CVD (by
8%), obesity-related cancer (by 6%), and prema-
ture death (by 5%) [20] (Fig. 1). This amount of
weight gain was also associated with 17% lower
likelihood of achieving healthy aging deﬁned as
being free of major chronic conditions and having
no substantial cognitive, physical, or mental limi-
tations after age 55. Moreover, individuals with the
body mass index (BMI) range of 18.5–22.4, com-
bined with higher levels of physical activity and
healthy diets had the lowest mortality, suggesting
that leanness induced by healthy diet and lifestyle
is optimal to promote longevity [21].

Given the impracticality of conducting long-term
calorie restriction trials, to a certain extent, the
analyses on life course body weight trajectories
in relation to health outcomes resemble a nat-
ural experiment.
Individuals who maintain a
lifelong leanness through healthy diet and lifestyle
practices tend to live longer and healthier lives,
mimicking results one might expect from long-term
calorie restriction studies. The fasting mimicking
diet, designed to provide health beneﬁts of fasting
without total food abstinence, has demonstrated
positive effects on weight loss and cardiometabolic
risk factors in short-term trials [22, 23], though
longer term data are needed.

Total and types of dietary fats

In many Asian populations, traditional diets often
feature lower fat intake compared to typical West-
ern diets. Previous cross-sectional and ecological
studies suggested an inverse association between
adherence to traditional Asian dietary patterns
and lower rates of CVD, cancer, and mortality [24].

lyzed separately. The beneﬁts of polyunsaturated
fats (PUFAs), especially linoleic acid, on CVD
and total mortality were conﬁrmed in systematic
reviews and meta-analysis of cohort studies using
biomarkers of linoleic acid intake [26, 27].

When interpreting these observed associations,
it is important to consider substitution effects
derived from isocaloric statistical modeling as such
analyses emulate a dietary intervention study,
while factoring in real-world dietary choices [28]. In
the aforementioned study, replacing 5% of energy
from saturated fat with the same amount of energy
from monounsaturated fats (MUFAs) and PUFAs
was associated with a 27% and 15% reduced risk
of mortality, respectively [25]. In another study
[29], replacing 5% of calories from saturated fat
with PUFAs, MUFAs, or whole grains was asso-
ciated with a 25%, 15%, and 9% lower risk of
coronary heart disease (CHD), respectively. How-
ever, based on the substitution modeling, replac-
ing saturated fat with carbohydrates from reﬁned
starches and added sugars did not alter CHD
risk. The food source of fat (plant or animal) may
also affect health outcomes, even when consider-
ing the same type of fat. For example, replacing
5% of energy intake from saturated fat, trans fat,
and reﬁned carbohydrates with MUFA intake from
plant sources (e.g., vegetable oils, nuts, seeds, and
avocados) was associated with lower risk of CHD,
whereas the same substitution with MUFA from
animal sources did not confer the same beneﬁcial
effects [30].

Types and food sources of protein

In model organisms, protein restriction or restric-
tion of particular amino acids—such as methio-
nine and tryptophan—has been shown to extend
life and promote healthy longevity, independent of
total caloric intake [31, 32]. One proposed mecha-
nism of the underlying beneﬁts of protein restric-
tion lies its effects on IGF-1. Lower protein intake
has been associated with decreased IGF-1 produc-
tion and signaling, which is linked to reduced risk
of cancer and slower aging [33].

the
Despite the strong experimental evidence,
extrapolation of
this evidence to humans is
complex due to differences in metabolism and
physiology. Levine et al. [34] analyzed data from
the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES) and found that the associations
between protein intake and mortality varied by age

However, these studies were strongly confounded
by socioeconomic factors. Over the past several
decades, a wealth of data from RCTs and large
cohort studies has provided compelling evidence
that different types of fats have different effects on
various health outcomes. In the NHS and HPFS,
types of fat were far more important than total
amount of fat in determining the long-term risk
of mortality [25]. Speciﬁcally, higher intakes of
unsaturated fats (found predominantly in plant-
based foods and marine ﬁsh) were associated with
lower mortality risk, with linoleic acid exhibiting
the strongest inverse association with mortality.
On the other hand, higher intakes of trans fat
and saturated fat were associated with increased
mortality with the adverse effects of trans fat
substantially stronger than those of saturated fat
(Fig. 2). These associations were consistent when
cause-speciﬁc mortality (including CVD mortality,
cancer mortality, and mortality due to respiratory
diseases or neurogenerative conditions) were ana-

groups and types of protein. Among individuals
aged 50–65-year old, high protein intake was asso-
ciated with a 75% increase in overall mortality and
a fourfold increase in cancer and diabetes mortal-
ity during 18 years of follow up. The association
was signiﬁcant only for animal protein but not for
plant protein. On the other hand, in individuals
aged 65 or older, higher protein intake was associ-
ated with lower mortality. However, the interaction
between protein intake and age on mortality has
not been observed in other cohorts. In the NHS and
HPFS, higher animal protein intake was positively
associated with cardiovascular mortality, whereas
higher plant protein intake was inversely associ-
ated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality
with no evidence of effect modiﬁcation by age [35].
In the substitution analysis, replacing animal pro-
tein sources (especially red and processed meats)
with plant protein sources was associated with
signiﬁcantly lower risk of all-cause mortality. In a
separate analysis, plant protein sources were also
associated with lower odds of cognitive decline
when compared with animal protein sources,
although adequate protein intake appears to be
important in the maintenance of cognition in older
individuals [36].

The importance of protein sources is further under-
scored by food-based analysis. In the NHS and
HPFS, an increase in 1 serving of processed and
unprocessed red meat per day was linked to a 13%
and 20% increased risk of mortality, respectively
[37]. Replacing 1 serving of red meat per day with
other foods, such as ﬁsh, poultry, legumes, nuts,
low-fat dairy, or whole grains, was associated with
a 7%–19% lower risk of premature death. Based
on the estimates from statistical modeling, if all
study participants in the cohorts had consumed
less than a half serving of red meat (42 g) per day,
9.3% of deaths in men and 7.6% in women could
have been prevented. Several systematic reviews
and meta-analyses have consistently found that
higher consumption of red and processed meats
was signiﬁcantly associated with increased risk of
developing type 2 diabetes, CVD, and some can-
cers, especially colorectal cancer [38–41]. More-
over, habitual consumption of unprocessed and
processed red meat was associated with a mod-
erately higher risk of frailty (deﬁned as having
≥3 of the following ﬁve criteria from the FRAIL
scale: fatigue, low strength, reduced aerobic capac-
ity, having ≥5 illnesses and weight loss ≥5%) [42].
Replacement of red meat by plant protein sources
was associated with lower risk of frailty.

Nuts—rich in plant protein and healthy fat—
have been studied extensively for their beneﬁts
on reducing risk of chronic diseases and mortal-
ity. Numerous short-term RCTs have shown that
incorporating nuts into regular diets signiﬁcantly
reduced total and LDL cholesterol levels [43]. Large
cohort studies have shown that regular consump-
tion of nuts was associated with signiﬁcantly lower
risk of type 2 diabetes [44], CVD [45], some cancers
[46], and mortality [47]. Peanuts, although botani-
cally legumes, appear to confer similar health ben-
eﬁts as tree nuts [48]. In the NHS and HPFS,
compared to participants who seldom ate nuts,
those who consumed nuts at least once daily had
a 20% lower death rate [49]. The inverse associ-
ations were similar for peanuts and tree nuts. In
addition, habitual consumption of nuts was asso-
ciated with signiﬁcantly lower risk of frailty [50]
and increased likelihood of healthy aging [51], sug-
gesting that nuts can be included in a dietary pat-
tern for the preservation of health and well-being
in older adults.

Carbohydrate quantity and quality

Low-carbohydrate or ketogenic diets have been
extensively studied in animal models and humans
for their impact on metabolic health outcomes
and longevity. Ketogenic diets are extreme low-
carbohydrate diets that induce a state of ketosis,
in which the body relies primarily on ketone bod-
ies for energy [52]. Animal studies suggest that a
ketogenic diet may enhance longevity and health
span through inﬂuencing multiple metabolic and
aging pathways, including reducing mTOR signal-
ing, AMPK and SIRT1 activation, improving insulin
sensitivity, and inhibiting chronic inﬂammation
[53, 54].

In short-term RCTs,
low-carbohydrate or keto-
genic diets have been shown to be more effective in
promoting weight loss compared to conventional
low-fat high-carbohydrate diets [55]. In addition,
carbohydrate restriction lowers blood glucose
levels, reduces postprandial glucose spikes, and
improves insulin sensitivity in glycemic control
among individuals with type 2 diabetes [56,
57]. However, long-term adherence to very low-
carbohydrate or ketogenic diets is often challenging
due to their restrictive nature. In addition, very
low-carbohydrate intake leads to reduced intake
of ﬁber, vitamins, and minerals, which could
have negative health consequences. Although
low-carbohydrate diets often decrease triglyceride

levels [52].

ing amounts of ﬁber, whole grains, fruit, and non-
starchy vegetables was associated with less weight
gain [69].

The long-term health effects of low-carbohydrate
diets appear to depend on the type of fat and pro-
tein in the diets [58]. During up to 20–26 years
of follow-up in NHS and HPFS, the overall low-
carbohydrate diet score was only weakly associ-
ated with all-cause mortality. However, a higher
animal
low-carbohydrate diet score was associ-
ated with higher all-cause and cancer mortality,
whereas a higher vegetable low-carbohydrate score
(emphasizing plant sources of protein and fat) was
associated with lower mortality, particularly CVD
mortality. Similarly, among individuals with type
2 diabetes, greater adherence to low-carbohydrate
diet patterns that emphasize plant sources of fat
and protein was signiﬁcantly associated with lower
total, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality [59]. It
should be noted that in real-world epidemiologic
studies, the amount of carbohydrates in the low-
carbohydrate diet pattern was much higher than
that used in controlled intervention studies of keto-
genic or very low-carbohydrate diets.

Numerous epidemiologic studies have investigated
the role of both quantity and quality of carbohy-
drates in long-term health outcomes and mortality.
Carbohydrate quality is typically deﬁned accord-
ing to its nutritional value and health effects,
including the degree of processing, ﬁber content,
and glycemic index and glycemic load [56]. Over-
all evidence suggests that carbohydrate quality
plays a more important role in chronic disease
outcomes than carbohydrate amount. A series
of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of data
from large cohort studies have shown that high
glycemic index or glycemic load diets (often con-
taining higher amounts of reﬁned grains, such
as white rice and white bread, starchy foods
such as potatoes, and sugar-sweetened beverages
[SSBs]), are consistently associated with increased
risk of weight gain, obesity, diabetes, CVD, some
cancers, and mortality [60–64], whereas mini-
legumes, whole fruits,
mally processed grains,
and non-starchy vegetables are protective against
these conditions [65–68]. In a recent longitudi-
nal analysis of changes in carbohydrate intake
and long-term weight gain in the NHS and HPFS,
increasing dietary glycemic index, glycemic load,
and amounts of starch, added sugars, reﬁned
grains, and starchy vegetables was associated with
greater midlife weight gain. In contrast, increas-

SSBs are a primary source of added sugars in many
diets and have been consistently associated with
increased risk of chronic diseases and mortality
[70]. In the NHS and HPFS, each serving per day
increment in SSBs was associated with a 7% higher
risk of total mortality (HR: 1.07; 95% CI: 1.05,
1.09), a 10% higher risk of CVD death (HR: 1.10;
95% CI: 1.06, 1.14), and a 5% higher risk of cancer
death (HR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02–1.08) [71]. The asso-
ciation between higher consumption of artiﬁcially
sweetened beverages (ASBs) and risk of mortality
was less clear. Higher consumption of SSBs and
ASBs was associated with a signiﬁcantly increased
risk of frailty [72].

SSBs promote weight gain and, consequently, ele-
vate the risk of chronic diseases through mul-
tiple mechanisms [70]. These include the body’s
incomplete compensation for liquid calorie intake
by not sufﬁciently reducing food intake at sub-
sequent meals, hyperinsulinemia resulting from
rapid absorption of
large amounts of sugar,
increased chronic inﬂammation, and potential
neural pathways linked to food addiction. Although
high consumption of these beverages increases
type 2 diabetes and cardiometabolic risk primar-
ily through weight gain, it also has direct impact.
Speciﬁcally, the high amount of glycemic load and
fructose in SSBs can lead to accumulation of vis-
ceral adipose tissue and ectopic lipid deposition
and increased risk of gout and nonalcoholic fatty
liver disease [70].

Polyphenol-rich plant foods

Polyphenols are a diverse group of naturally
occurring compounds found in plant-based foods,
such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts,
and legumes—including soy products, coffee, tea,
cocoa, red wine, herbs, and spices [73, 74]. There
are thousands of different polyphenols, which
including
can be categorized into subclasses,
ﬂavonoids (found in fruits, vegetables, tea, coffee,
cocoa, and soy), lignans (found in seeds, grains,
and vegetables), phenolic acids (found in coffee,
nuts, and fruits), and resveratrol (found in grapes
and wine). Because of their antioxidant, anti-
inﬂammatory, and anticarcinogenic properties,
polyphenol-rich foods are considered an impor-
tant component of healthy dietary patterns that

promote overall health and well-being. In addition
to their cardiometabolic beneﬁts, such as improved
blood lipid proﬁles and reduced blood pressure,
polyphenols have the potential to improve cogni-
tive function and lower the risk of neurodegener-
ative diseases [75, 76]. Furthermore, they act as
prebiotics, promoting the growth of beneﬁcial gut
bacteria and maintaining a healthy gut microbiome
[74]. Experimental studies indicate that polyphe-
nols exhibit antiaging properties by inﬂuencing
various hallmarks of aging, including inﬂamma-
tion, oxidative stress, epigenetic alterations, and
protein homeostasis [77]. Below we highlight epi-
demiologic and clinical trial evidence on the health
beneﬁts of several polyphenol-rich foods, such as
coffee, tea, extra-virgin olive oil, blueberries, avoca-
dos, and culinary herbs and spices, as an exhaus-
tive review of all major foods high in polyphenols
is beyond the scope of this paper. It is worth not-
ing that foods rich in polyphenols also contain
other beneﬁcial nutrients and compounds, such as
minerals, vitamins, and carotenoids. Carotenoids,
which are phytochemicals with antioxidant effects
that give plant foods their vibrant colors, have been
associated with lower risk of chronic diseases [78,
79]. Therefore, the health beneﬁts of these foods
may result from a combination of many compo-
nents, not just polyphenols alone.

Among polyphenol-rich foods, coffee stands out
as a major source of polyphenols in many pop-
ulations. Chlorogenic acids are the most abun-
dant polyphenols in coffee, possessing strong
anti-inﬂammatory and antioxidant properties.
Numerous epidemiologic studies have examined
the associations between coffee consumption and
risk of chronic diseases [80]. Consistent evidence
has shown that moderate coffee consumption
(3–5 standard cups per day) is associated with
reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes, CVD,
and some cancers, such as liver, endometrial, and
colorectal cancer. Moderate coffee consumption is
also associated with lower risk of premature death
in diverse populations [81, 82]. In addition, coffee
consumption has been associated with a reduced
risk of cognitive disorders [83] and Parkinson’s
disease [84]. Moreover, there is consistent evi-
dence that coffee consumption is associated with
a reduced risk of depression [85] and suicide
[86]. The health beneﬁts of coffee are likely due to
various bioactive compounds including polyphe-
nols, although caffeine—a central nervous system
stimulant—also plays a role in improving cognitive
function and reducing risk of neurodegenerative

It should be noted that

diseases.
individuals’
response to coffee can vary depending on genetics,
and social and behavioral factors [80].

Regular consumption of tea has been associated
with myriad health beneﬁts, including lower risk
of type 2 diabetes, CVD, and mortality [87, 88],
although the overall evidence is less consistent and
robust compared to that for coffee. Green tea has
received a great deal of attention because of its high
contents of catechins and other polyphenols with
potent antioxidant effects. Green tea polyphenols—
particularly epigallocatechin gallate—have been
shown to improve blood lipid proﬁles, reduce blood
pressure, and enhance vascular function [89, 90].
These polyphenols have also been associated with
improved cognitive function and lower risk of neu-
rodegenerative diseases [91].

Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) is obtained from the
mechanical pressing of olives without the use of
heat or chemicals. Compared to regular olive oil,
EVOO contains higher amounts of polyphenols
such as oleuropein and hydroxytyrosol, which con-
tribute to its color and ﬂavor as well as potential
health beneﬁts [92, 93]. High olive oil consump-
tion is a hallmark of the traditional Mediterranean
diet (MedDiet), which has been consistently associ-
ated with lower risk of chronic diseases and mortal-
ity [94]. In the PREDIMED trial, participants who
followed a MedDiet supplemented with EVOO or
mixed nuts had signiﬁcantly reduced risk of CVD
including strokes, heart attacks, and cardiovascu-
lar deaths compared to the control group [95]. The
intervention group supplemented with EVOO also
had signiﬁcantly reduced risk of type 2 diabetes
[96] and breast cancer [97]. Despite relatively low
consumption of olive oil compared to Spanish or
other European populations, participants in the
NHS and HPFS who consumed four or more table-
spoons of olive oil per week had signiﬁcantly lower
risk of developing type 2 diabetes [98], CVD [99],
and mortality [100].

the PREDIMED trial,

In a subsample of
the
participants assigned to the MedDiet group sup-
plemented with either EVOO or mixed nuts
experienced signiﬁcantly improved cognitive func-
tion compared to the control group [101]. These
beneﬁts are likely due to both the antioxidant
and anti-inﬂammatory effects of polyphenols in
the intervention diets as well as the indirect
effects through improved vascular function by the
interventions with their healthy fats.

Blueberries are rich in polyphenols, especially
anthocyanins. Prospective analyses using data
from NHS and HPFS have shown that higher
consumption of anthocyanins or blueberries was
associated with lower risk of type 2 diabetes [102],
CVD [103, 104], and all-cause mortality [105]. In
the longest duration RCT to date among partic-
ipants with metabolic syndrome, 1 cup [150 g]
of blueberries/d for 6 months led to clinically
signiﬁcant improvements in endothelial function,
systemic arterial stiffness, and HDL-cholesterol
levels, compared to the control group [106].

In animal studies, supplementation with blueber-
ries led to improvements in cognitive and motor
behaviors as well as in learning and memory [107].
Small RCTs in humans have shown that blueberry
supplementation improves cognitive performance
in children and older adults [108]. In the NHS
and HPFS, higher consumption of total ﬂavonoids
and subclasses,
including ﬂavones, ﬂavanones,
and anthocyanins, was associated with lower odds
In
of subjective cognitive decline [SCD]

includ-
ing berries, oranges, grapefruits, citrus juices,
apples/pears, celery, peppers, and bananas, were
signiﬁcantly associated with lower likelihood of
SCD.

[109].

Avocados are a nutrient-rich fruit that contain a
variety of beneﬁcial components, such as ﬁber,
monounsaturated fat, potassium, and magne-
sium, and bioactive compounds including polyphe-
nols, especially ﬂavonoids [110]. Small RCTs have
shown that diets that incorporated avocados sig-
niﬁcantly decreased LDL cholesterol levels [111].
[112] higher avocado
In the NHS and HPFS,
intake (≥2 servings/week) was associated with a
16% lower risk of CVD (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75–
0.95) and a 21% lower risk of CHD (HR, 0.79;
95% CI, 0.68–0.91). No signiﬁcant associations
were observed for stroke. In substitution analyses,
replacing half a serving/day of margarine, butter,
egg, yogurt, cheese, or processed meats with the
equivalent amount of avocado was associated with
a 16% to 22% lower risk of CVD.

Herbs and spices are widely used in global
cuisines, contributing not only to diversity of
ﬂavor but also potential health beneﬁts due to
their rich content of bioactive compounds, includ-
ing polyphenols [113]. Notable examples include
turmeric in Indian dishes; basil, rosemary, and
oregano in Mediterranean cuisine; and ginger, gar-

lic, and cloves in East Asian cuisines. Experimen-
tal studies have indicated that many herbs and
spices have antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anti-
tumorigenic properties [113]. Beyond its culinary
use, turmeric has historically been used in Chinese
and Indian traditional medicine for treating various
diseases and conditions. Curcumin—a polyphenol
and the active component of turmeric—has been
extensively studied in recent decades, demonstrat-
ing its potential antioxidant, anti-inﬂammatory,
anti-diabetes, and anticancer effects [114]. A sys-
tematic review and meta-analysis of 64 RCTs found
that
turmeric/curcumin supplementation was
effective in improving blood levels of TC, TG, LDL-c,
and HDL-c [115]. Turmeric/curcumin supplemen-
tation has also been shown to improve markers
of liver function [116]. Moreover, curcumin sup-
plementation signiﬁcantly increased serum brain-
derived neurotrophic factor levels [117], which
might have positive effects on cognitive function,
learning, and memory. Despite these encouraging
results, the quality of these RCTs is generally low
due to limited sample sizes, short durations, and
varied supplement preparations. Recently, a ran-
domized, crossover, controlled feeding study found
that the addition of a relatively high dosage of
mixed herbs and spices to a standard US-style diet
signiﬁcantly improved 24-h blood pressure but did
not affect other cardiometabolic risk factors after
four weeks, compared with lower dosages among
adults at elevated risk of cardiometabolic diseases
[118]. In epidemiologic studies, the low consump-
tion levels of herbs and spices and lack of speciﬁc
biomarkers of their intakes make it challenging
to examine their associations with long-term out-
comes. Nevertheless, incorporating turmeric and
other herbs and spices into diets can offer promis-
ing approaches for enhancing health. Going for-
ward, more rigorous research is needed to stan-
dardize spice and herb extracts and preparations,
obtain more accurate information about the chem-
ical proﬁles or active ingredients, develop spe-
ciﬁc biomarkers for these compounds, and better
understand underlying molecular pathways [113].

Taken together, the health beneﬁts of polyphenol-
rich foods,
including coffee, tea, EVOO, blue-
berries, and avocados, are well supported by
the convergence of evidence from observational
cohort studies, small-scale RCTs, and mechanistic
studies. In addition, emerging evidence suggests
potential health beneﬁts associated with culi-
nary herbs and spices prevalent
in global
cuisines. Although further research is needed to

understand the biological mechanisms underlying
these effects, these ﬁndings highlight the impor-
tance of
including a variety of polyphenol-rich
foods in a healthy dietary pattern to promote
healthy aging and longevity.

Healthy dietary patterns

foods or nutrients are not
Because individual
typically consumed in isolation, it is important to
understand health effects of overall dietary pat-
terns, which can provide a more comprehensive
view of overall diet, reﬂecting real-world eating
habits [119]. Moreover, evaluating overall dietary
patterns can help capture the synergistic or
antagonistic effects of different food components
consumed concurrently and reduce confound-
ing from intercorrelated dietary components.
Moreover, dietary patterns can take into account
cultural and regional variations in diet, making
dietary recommendations more adaptable and
relevant for diverse global populations.

The Mediterranean diet (MedDiet). The traditional
MedDiet is widely considered a model for healthy
eating. The main features of the MedDiet include
an abundance of plant foods, such as fruits, veg-
etables, whole grains, nuts, and legumes; olive oil
as the main source of dietary fat; ﬁsh and poultry
consumed in low-to-moderate amounts; relatively
low consumption of red meat; and moderate con-
sumption of wine, typically in conjunction with
meals [94]. A recent comprehensive review [120]
conducted by Guasch-Ferre and Willett sum-
marized the extensive body of evidence from both
observational studies and clinical trials on the rela-
tionships between adherence to the Mediterranean
dietary patterns and a wide spectrum of health out-
comes. Overall, there is compelling evidence that
greater adherence to the MedDiet is associated with
reduced risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, hyper-
tension, dyslipidemia, CHD, stroke, and heart
failure. In prospective cohort studies, adherence
to the Mediterranean dietary pattern is associated
with reduced mortality, especially cardiovascular
mortality, thus contributing to increased longevity.
In addition, the MedDiet has been associated with
slower progression of age-related cognitive decline
[121] and lower risk of neurodegenerative disor-
ders such as dementia and Alzheimer’s disease
[122]. The MIND diet (Mediterranean-DASH Inter-
vention for Neurodegenerative Delay)—a hybrid of
the MedDiet and the DASH (Dietary Approaches
to Stop Hypertension) diet—has been consistently

associated with a decreased risk of cognitive
decline and dementia in large cohort studies [123].
However, a recent RCT did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant
effects of the MIND diet intervention on changes
in cognition over three years [124]. The relatively
short duration of the intervention and similar
weight loss between the intervention and control
groups might have contributed to the null ﬁndings.

The Nordic diet. Similar to the MedDiet, the Nordic
diet focuses on plant-based and locally sourced
foods that are typically found in the Nordic coun-
tries, such as Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Iceland,
and Finland [125]. One notable difference between
the MedDiet and the Nordic diet is the type of oil
used. The MedDiet mainly uses EVOO, whereas
in the Nordic diet rapeseed oil is commonly used.
Although olive oil is high in oleic acid, rapeseed
oil is rich in oleic acid, linoleic acid, and alpha-
linolenic acid. The types of whole grains in the
Nordic regions are mostly rye, barley, and oats.
Among various fruits, berries are featured more
prominently in the Nordic diet.

Compared to the MedDiet, the extent of research
available regarding health beneﬁts of the Nordic
diet is more limited and more recent. A system-
atic review and meta-analysis summarized data on
Nordic dietary patterns and cardiometabolic out-
comes from 15 prospective cohort studies [126] and
6 RCTs. In cohort studies, adherence to the Nordic
dietary pattern was associated with a small reduc-
tion in risk of CVD (7%) and type 2 diabetes (9%).
Small RCTs showed that the Nordic dietary pat-
tern led to a modest reduction in LDL-cholesterol,
ApoB, body weight, insulin, and SBP, compared
to a control diet. Several cohort studies suggested
that adherence to the MedDiet was more strongly
associated with total mortality than adherence to
the Nordic diet [125]. While the landmark PRED-
IMED trial has demonstrated the beneﬁts of the
MedDiet supplemented with EVOO or mixed nuts
on CVD and other clinical end points, no such trial
has been conducted to investigate long-term effects
of the Nordic diet.

The Okinawa diet. The traditional Okinawa diet
has been linked to high concentrations of cen-
tenarians on the island of Okinawa [127, 128].
This dietary pattern resembles a vegetarian diet,
characterized by its emphasis on root vegetables
(mainly purple sweet potatoes), green and yellow
vegetables, soybean-based foods, seaweeds and
algae, tea, and a variety of medicinal plants (e.g.

bitter melon) and spices such as turmeric. Ani-
mal food consumption is often limited except for
marine ﬁsh in coastal regions of the island. In
addition to its food composition, a unique feature
of the Okinawan diet is the practice of stopping
eating when one is 80% full, known as Hara Hachi
Bu [129]. This practice is akin to a natural form of
mild caloric restriction.

Okinawa is one of the ﬁve “Blue Zones,” a con-
cept introduced by Buettner [130]. In addition to
Okinawa, the other Blue Zones include Sardinia
in Italy, Nicoya Peninsula in Costa Rica, Ikaria
in Greece, and Loma Linda in California, USA.
These regions were recognized for their residents’
longevity and high numbers of centenarians. The
diets of the Blue Zones are believed to play a cru-
cial role in the exceptional longevity observed in
these regions. However, the lifestyles in the Blue
Zones also encompass shared features, such as
plant-based eating, moderation in consumption,
being physically active, and strong familial and
social connections. Therefore, it is not possible to
attribute the longevity observed in these regions
solely to their diets.

Although the traditional diets in the Blue Zones
have garnered much attention for their poten-
tial inﬂuence on longevity and health, it is worth
noting that not all these diets and their health
effects have been rigorously studied. In particular,
while the Seventh-day Adventists Study based in
Loma Linda is a well-established cohort to exam-
ine long-term effects of diet on health outcomes
and longevity spanning decades [131], the diets in
other Blue Zone regions and their health implica-
tions have been less well described. Moreover, the
diets in the Blue Zones have evolved over time and
thus differ substantially from traditional practices
due to shifts in social-economic and cultural fac-
tors. For instance, the Okinawa diet has undergone
considerable Westernization in recent years, which
might have contributed to the rise of chronic dis-
eases and decreased life expectancy on the island
[132].

Vegetarian and other plant-based diets. Plant-
based diets consist of a diverse spectrum of dietary
patterns, generally deﬁned by limited consump-
tion of animal foods. Vegetarian diets are a major
category of plant-based diets ranging from partial
to complete exclusion of animal products, such
as vegan diets [133]. Small RCTs have shown
that compared to participants’ usual diets, vege-

tarian diets signiﬁcantly reduced blood pressure,
total and LDL cholesterol
levels, body weight,
HbA1c, and other cardiometabolic risk factors
[134]. Large cohort studies have shown that veg-
etarians tended to have lower risk of obesity, type
2 diabetes, and CHD than nonvegetarians [134].
In the Seventh-day Adventist Health Study, par-
ticipants who followed vegetarian or vegan diets
had reduced mortality and longer life expectan-
cies compared to the general population [135].
In addition, participants following vegetarian diets
had lower rates of certain cancers—particularly
colon, breast, and prostate cancers [134]. More-
over, vegetarian diets were associated with bet-
ter cognitive function and a lower risk of cogni-
tive decline among Adventists [136]. Although the
Seventh-day Adventist Health Study has provided
valuable insights into the health beneﬁts of vege-
tarian diets, caution is warranted when applying
these ﬁndings to the broader population because
the participants’ other lifestyle practices and reli-
gious beneﬁts might have contributed to some of
the observed health outcomes. In addition, it is
important to pay attention to nutritional adequacy
(vitamins B12 and D, iron, calcium, zinc, and long-
chain omega-3 fatty acids) of vegetarian diets, par-
ticularly vegan diets that entirely exclude animal
foods.

Traditionally, plant-based diets are quantiﬁed by
the reduced amount and frequency of animal-
based food consumption, often overlooking the
quality of the plant-based foods consumed. How-
ever, there is large heterogeneity among plant
foods in terms of
their nutritional value and
health effects. Therefore, we examined two dis-
tinct variations of plant-based dietary patterns
[133]: A healthful plant-based index (hPDI) that
favors high-quality nutrient-dense plant-based
foods (whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, and
legumes) and minimizes less healthy plant foods
(reﬁned grains, potatoes, SSBs) and animal prod-
ucts; and an unhealthful plant-based index (uPDI)
that is comprised mostly of
less healthy plant
foods (sugar and reﬁned carbohydrates) and with
less intake of healthy plant foods. In the NHS
and HPFS, there were divergent associations for
healthy versus unhealthy plant-based diet indices
and risk of type 2 diabetes [137], CHD [138],
and stroke [139]. For instance, an overall plant-
based diet index was modestly inversely associ-
ated with incident CHD (HR comparing extreme
deciles: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.83–1.01; p-trend = 0.003).
This inverse association was substantially stronger

for hPDI (HR comparing extreme deciles: 0.75;
95% CI: 0.68–0.83; p-trend < 0.001). However,
the association was positive for uPDI (HR compar-
ing extreme deciles: 1.32; 95% CI: 1.20–1.46; p-
trend < 0.001). Adherence to a healthful plant-
based diet was associated with improvements in
both physical and mental dimensions of health-
related quality of life [140]. In the VA Million Vet-
eran Program [141], hPDI was inversely associated
with total mortality (HR comparing extreme deciles
= 0.64, 95% CI: 0.61–0.68), whereas uPDI was pos-
itively associated with total mortality (HR compar-
ing extreme deciles = 1.41, 95% CI: 1.33–1.49). The
associations between the plant-based diet indices
and total mortality were consistent among African
and European American participants.

Besides the healthful plant-based diets deﬁned by
hPDI, there are a variety of healthy plant-based
dietary patterns deﬁned by other dietary indices,
such as the Healthy Eating Index 2015 (HEI-2015)
based on Dietary Guidelines for Americans [142],
Alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI) based on
Harvard’s Healthy Eating Plate [143] (Fig. 3), the
DASH score [144, 145], the Portfolio diet score

[146, 147], empirical dietary inﬂammatory pattern
score [148, 149], and the planetary health diet
index [150] (see Table 1).

We recently conducted a comparative analysis of
four healthy dietary patterns (HEI-2015, AHEI,
hPDI, and aMED) in relation to mortality risk in the
NHS and HPFS [151]. When comparing the highest
with the lowest quintiles, the pooled multivariable-
adjusted HRs of total mortality were 0.81 (95%CI,
0.79–0.84) for HEI-2015, 0.82 (95%CI, 0.79–0.84)
for aMED score, 0.86 [95%CI, 0.83–0.89] for hPDI,
and 0.80 [95%CI, 0.77–0.82] for AHEI [p < .001
for trend for all]. All dietary scores were signiﬁ-
cantly inversely associated with death from CVD,
cancer, and respiratory disease. The aMED score
and AHEI were inversely associated with mortality
from neurodegenerative disease. The inverse asso-
ciations between these scores and risk of mortal-
ity were consistent in different racial and ethnic
groups, including Hispanic, non-Hispanic Black,
and non-Hispanic White individuals. These ﬁnd-
ings support that multiple healthy eating patterns
can be adapted to individual food preferences and
cultural traditions.

The combined effects of diet and lifestyle on healthy
longevity

Healthy longevity is inﬂuenced not only by diet but
also various lifestyle factors, including smoking,
physical activity, alcohol consumption, and body
weight. Given the interconnected nature of these
factors, it is useful to examine the combined effects
of diet and lifestyle factors on longevity. Using
data from NHS and HPFS [152], we deﬁned ﬁve
low-risk lifestyle factors as fulﬁlling either: never
smoking, maintaining normal weight (BMI 18.5–
24.9 kg/m2), 30+ minutes/day moderate to vigor-
ous physical activity, moderate alcohol intake (no
more than one drink per day for women and no
more than two for men), and a high-quality diet

as indicated by the AHEI in the upper 40%. The
multivariable-adjusted HRs for mortality in adults
with ﬁve low-risk factors compared with those with
none were 0.26 (95% CI: 0.22–0.31) for all-cause
mortality, 0.35 (95% CI: 0.27–0.45) for cancer mor-
tality, and 0.18 (95% CI: 0.12–0.26) for CVD mor-
tality. We estimated that the life expectancy at
age 50 was 29.0 years (95% CI: 28.3–29.8) for
females and 25.5 years (95% CI: 24.7–26.2) for
males who adopted zero low-risk lifestyle factors
and 43.1 years (95% CI: 41.3–44.9) for females
and 37.6 years (95% CI: 35.8–39.4) for males who
adopted ﬁve low-risk lifestyle factors (Fig. 4). Con-
sequently, adhering to all ﬁve low-risk factors could
potentially prolong life expectancy at age 50 by

Fig. 4 Life expectancy estimated based on overall mortality rate of Americans (CDC report), the prevalence of lifestyle factors
using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data 2013–2014 and age- and sex-speciﬁc hazard
ratios (a: hazard ratio; b: life expectancy at age 50; c: life expectancy by age). Low-risk lifestyle factors included cigarette
smoking (never smoking), physically active (≥3.5 h/week moderate to vigorous intensity activity), high diet quality (upper
40% of alternative healthy eating index (AHEI), moderate alcohol intake of 5–15 g/day (female) or 5–30 g/day (male),
and normal weight (body mass index < 25 kg/m2). The estimates of cumulative survival from 50 years of age onward
among the ﬁve lifestyle risk factor groups were calculated by applying: (1) all-cause and cause-speciﬁc mortality rates were
obtained from the US CDC WONDER database; (2) distribution of different numbers of low-risk lifestyles was based on the
US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2013–2014; (3) multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios (sex-
and age-speciﬁc) for all-cause mortality associated with the ﬁve low-risk lifestyles as compared to those without any low-
risk lifestyle factors, adjusted for ethnicity, current multivitamin use, current aspirin use, family history of diabetes mellitus,
myocardial infarction, or cancer, and menopausal status and hormone use (females only), were based on data from the
Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) and Health Professionals’ Follow-up Study (HPFS). Source: The ﬁgure originally published in

14.0 years for females and 12.2 years for males,
in comparison to those adopting none.

In further analyses, adherence to the low-
risk lifestyle was associated with a longer life
expectancy at age 50 free of major chronic diseases
(cancer, CVD, and diabetes) of approximately 7.6
years in men and 10 years in women compared
with participants with no low-risk lifestyle fac-
tors [153]. These ﬁndings suggest that most of the
extended life expectancies resulting from a healthy
diet and lifestyle are free from major chronic dis-
eases. In other words, following a healthy diet and
lifestyle not only enhances overall life span but
also extends health span, contributing to a longer
period of disease-free life expectancy. Adherence to
these lifestyle factors was also strongly associated
with lower risk of frailty in older women [154].

Summary and public health implications

This review provides an overview of dietary fac-
tors related to longevity and healthy aging, pri-
marily based on ﬁndings from large cohort stud-
ies. First, maintaining a healthy weight across var-
ious life stages is crucial for achieving longevity
and healthy aging. This approach—reminiscent of
the “80% full” principle found in the traditional
Okinawan diet—mimics the positive effects of life-
long, moderate calorie restriction, especially within
today’s obesogenic food environment.

Second, the speciﬁc food sources or types of
dietary fat, protein, and carbohydrates appear to be
more important in inﬂuencing the risk of chronic
diseases and mortality than their quantity. The
debate on the superiority of low-fat versus low-
carbohydrate diets is not meaningful unless the
food sources of fats or carbohydrates are clearly
deﬁned. For example, the speciﬁc food sources of
macronutrients can alter the relationship between
carbohydrate intake and mortality risk. A low-
carbohydrate diet dominated by animal-derived fat
or protein was associated with higher mortality,
but a low-carbohydrate diet rich in plant-based fat
and protein was associated with lower mortality.

Third, although there is no one-size-ﬁts-all diet for
everyone, some traditional diets such as the Med-
Diet, Nordic, and Asian and contemporary dietary
patterns such as HEI-2015, the AHEI, and the
DASH diet share many common components while
embracing distinct elements from diverse cultures.
These dietary patterns typically emphasize mini-

mally processed plant foods and healthy fats, cou-
pled with reduced consumption of red and pro-
cessed meats and added sugars. The existence of
multiple healthy eating patterns across diverse cul-
tures offers the ﬂexibility of combining beneﬁcial
elements of various dietary patterns to create per-
sonalized diets that enhance long-term enjoyment
and adherence.

Fourth, a healthy diet often includes a variety of
plant foods rich in polyphenols and other phytonu-
trients with antioxidant and anti-inﬂammatory
properties. Higher consumption of polyphenols has
been associated with beneﬁcial effects on the gut
microbiome [155] and small-molecule metabolites
[156], contributing to better physical and mental
health. Polyphenol-rich foods drawn from diverse
cultures and regions of the world, such as coffee,
tea, a variety of fruits and vegetables, cocoa, EVOO,
avocados, nuts, and seeds, can be tailored to ﬁt
individuals’ own food preferences and cultures.

Fifth, adopting a healthy diet along with other
lifestyle factors (not smoking, engaging in regu-
lar physical activity, maintaining a healthy weight,
and consuming alcohol
in moderation [if any])
can potentially add approximately 8 to 10 years
of disease-free life expectancy. Beyond physical
health and longevity, a healthy diet and lifestyle
can help to promote mental well-being and mitigate
age-related cognitive decline, reducing the risk of
dementia and enhancing the overall quality of life.

Lastly, healthy dietary patterns’ emphasis on
plant-based foods and sustainable practices aligns
with concerns about the environmental impact of
the global food system. They are widely recognized
to not only reduce risk of chronic diseases and mor-
tality but also contribute to lower greenhouse gas
emissions, resulting in lower environmental impact
[157, 158].

These ﬁndings hold important clinical and public
health implications. Health professionals should
encourage and support individuals to maintain
a healthy weight and prevent excess weight gain
across all life stages. Balancing dietary choices
and physical activity levels, coupled with regular
weight monitoring, are practical strategies in coun-
tering age-related weight gain. For older adults,
it is critical to address concerns related to sar-
copenia and unintentional weight loss and frailty
due to chronic conditions through appropriate
dietary strategies including maintaining adequate

protein intake and taking vitamin or mineral sup-
plements when necessary. Recent RCTs have sug-
gested that daily multivitamin supplements moder-
ately improved memory and other cognitive func-
tions in older adults [159, 160], though further
conﬁrmation of these ﬁndings is needed. More-
over, clinicians should promote a holistic approach
to healthy aging by emphasizing not only dietary
habits but also other lifestyle factors, including
regular exercise, avoidance of smoking and excess
alcohol drinking, ensuring sufﬁcient sleep, and fos-
tering meaningful social connections.

From the public health point of view, policies and
initiatives should aim to create a healthier food
environment where nutritious options are not only
accessible but also the default [161]. This extends
to homes, health care facilities, and nursing care
facilities for older adults. Public health measures,
such as soda taxes,
front-of-package labeling,
and restricting unhealthy food marketing, can
shift societal norms and guide individuals toward
In addition, public
healthier eating behaviors.
health strategies must address the pervasive con-
sumption of ultra-processed foods of low nutri-
tional value, which have been linked to increased
obesity and chronic diseases [162, 163]. Reduc-
ing consumption of these foods not only improves
physical health but also positively impacts men-
tal well-being. Finally, by focusing on both human
health and planetary health, public health strate-
gies should encourage the adoption of healthy
plant-based foods while minimizing the environ-
mental footprint of dietary choices [164, 165]. This
requires incorporating environmental sustainabil-
ity into dietary guidelines for healthy aging as well
as broader agricultural and food policies.

Future research directions

Given that the majority of studies on diet and
healthy aging have been conducted in US and
European populations, there is an urgent need
to conduct long-term cohort studies in diverse
populations with varied cultural traditions and
eating patterns. Even though the diets from the
Blue Zones are considered models for healthy
aging, more rigorous investigations are required
to better understand nutritional proﬁles and the
health consequences of these diets. To achieve this
goal, it is vital to develop better dietary assessment
tools that are suitable for culturally diverse popu-
lations. Although traditional self-reported instru-
ments, such as food frequency questionnaires,

24-h recalls, and food records, will likely remain
as the mainstay for large-scale population-based
studies, it is crucial to develop objective biomark-
ers to improve the assessment of various dietary
patterns and their components. Although high-
throughput metabolomics have shown promise in
identifying biomarkers of speciﬁc food intakes and
dietary patterns, it is imperative to validate these
biomarkers across diverse populations [166, 167].

Recognizing that various eating patterns have over-
lapping components but also unique features, it is
useful to conduct intervention studies to test the
effects of combining multiple beneﬁcial elements
of different eating patterns on health outcomes. A
recent 18-month RCT conducted in Israel demon-
strated that compared to a control diet, a diet rich
in polyphenols achieved by integrating the com-
ponents of MedDiet with walnuts, green tea, and
Mankai (a speciﬁc duckweed strain) shake led to a
signiﬁcant reduction in visceral adiposity [168] and
age-related brain atrophy [169]. This “fusion diet”
approach not only ampliﬁes the beneﬁts of dietary
strategies to reduce chronic diseases and promote
healthy aging but also enhances acceptability by
broader populations.

There is an increasing need to identify reliable
biomarkers that reﬂect the effects of diet on healthy
aging outcomes. Such biomarkers can provide
insights into mechanisms by which diet inﬂuences
aging and offer potential end points for assessing
the efﬁcacy of dietary interventions. Although
epigenetic clocks and telomere lengths are emerg-
ing as promising biomarkers for aging research,
their broad applications in clinical settings require
further research and validation [170, 171]. This
underscores the need for a deeper understanding
of the biological mechanisms underlying diet and
healthy aging. Emerging evidence suggests that
certain dietary patterns, such as the MedDiet
and its components, could inﬂuence multiple
molecular pathways related to healthy aging [172].
These include reduction of chronic inﬂammation
and oxidative stress, decreased rates of telomere
shortening and epigenetic aging, amelioration of
mitochondrial dysfunction, maintenance of protein
homeostasis, and regulation of nutrient-sensing
pathways. Given our limited understanding of
these mechanisms, more in-depth mechanistic
studies and human trials are needed to better
elucidate the molecular pathways, which can help
develop biomarkers that better characterize the
effects of diet on the aging process.
