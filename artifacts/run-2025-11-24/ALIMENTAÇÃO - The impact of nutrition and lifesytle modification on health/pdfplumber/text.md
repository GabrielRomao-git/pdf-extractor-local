factors. Therefore, nutrition and diets were also included in different randomized clinical trials, and most of them
showed a favorable impact of nutrition modification on the participant’s health. Nevertheless, study designs were
considerably different, and future studies are needed to support nutrition modifications further.
The choice of a healthy considered diet, like the Mediterranean diet, was shown to impact chronic diseases,
cardiovascular risk, and adult life expectancy mainly due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.
Furthermore, a high intake of fibers, fruits, and vegetables together with a low intake of fat and energy-dense,
processed foods contribute to an inflammation reduction and a more robust immune system leading. Besides
these well-known properties, all lifestyle modifications must be personalized according to the availability of
foods, geographic localizations, and the healthy status of the patient.
