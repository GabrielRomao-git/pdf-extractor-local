The main recommendations from public health entities include healthy diets and physical activity as the main 
lifestyle factors impacting the development of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, 
cancer, and even neurological diseases. 
Randomized clinical trials have been designed to demonstrate those lifestyle modifications can change the 
pattern of chronic diseases development and progression. Among these, nutrition is one of the most impacting 
factors. Therefore, nutrition and diets were also included in different randomized clinical trials, and most of them 
showed a favorable impact of nutrition modification on the participant’s health. Nevertheless, study designs were 
considerably different, and future studies are needed to support nutrition modifications further. 
The choice of a healthy considered diet, like the Mediterranean diet, was shown to impact chronic diseases, 
cardiovascular risk, and adult life expectancy mainly due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. 
Furthermore, a high intake of fibers, fruits, and vegetables together with a low intake of fat and energy-dense, 
processed foods contribute to an inflammation reduction and a more robust immune system leading. Besides 
these well-known properties, all lifestyle modifications must be personalized according to the availability of 
foods, geographic localizations, and the healthy status of the patient.   
1. Introduction 
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Non­
communicable Diseases (NCDs), heart disease, stroke, diabetes, obesity, 
metabolic syndrome, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and some 
types of cancer represent 63% of annual global deaths. Furthermore, it is 
estimated that by 2030 NCDs will be responsible for 52 million annual 
deaths worldwide [1]. Therefore, these diseases are considered major 
chronic diseases that together are responsible for high mortality rates 
that are preventable in large part [2]. 
Several studies provide evidence that regular physical activity, 
maintaining healthy body weight, not smoking, and following correct 
nutritional and other health-promoting practices influence health in a 
decisive way [3]. Thus, different factors from patients’ lifestyle 
contribute to the prevention of chronic diseases, and therefore the 
concept of Lifestyle Medicine (LM) can be adopted to support the 
reduction of the risk related to lifestyle factors [2,3]. The focus of this 
review is to highlight the impact of nutrition on health and clinical 
outcomes associated with chronic, metabolically active diseases. 
2. Lifestyle medicine 
According to the definition of the American College of Lifestyle 
Medicine, the Australian Lifestyle Medicine Association, and the Euro­
pean Lifestyle Medicine Organization, LM is "the research and clinical 
prevention and treatment of dysfunctions caused by a non-physiological 
lifestyle accumulating allostatic load (lifestyle-related diseases, LRDs)” 
and/or “prevention and treatment of LRDs through nutritional, exercise, 
psychological, social, environmental and pharmaceutical interventions” 
[4]. 
Being such an important field, it is interesting to realize that LM 
concepts are not common subjects as a part of the medical school’s 
curriculum [2,5] For instance, in what concerns nutrition, despite 
several recommendations to include it in medical student’s curriculum, 
most medical schools in Europe and worldwide do not have adequate 
training in nutrition nor specialized qualified faculty [6]. A systematic 
review analyzing several articles and studies about nutrition in medical 
schools worldwide concluded that graduating medical students are not 
adequately supported in providing effective nutrition counseling to

patients [7]. In the United States, nutrition is taught in less than 25% of 
medical schools [8–10]. This is similar in the United Kingdom, where 
most physicians do not value nutrition as an essential part of the doctor’s 
responsibility to direct it to other staff members in the health care sys­
tem [11]. Nevertheless, there are hundreds of clinical studies supporting 
the positive impact of lifestyle modifications on health. Table 1 includes 
a summary of the key interventional randomized studies registered at 
clinical trials.gov, assessing the impact of lifestyle modifications on 
clinical outcomes [12–17]. 
Due to the strength of the scientific evidence supporting the impact 
of lifestyle habits, the recent evidence-based clinical guidelines incor­
porate lifestyle recommendations to prevent chronic metabolically 
related diseases [18–30]. In all of them was emphasized that lifestyle 
habits are critical components for the prevention and adjuvant treat­
ments of chronic diseases. At the same time, modification of harmful 
lifestyle habits could be an indirect form of reducing the health system 
costs [31]. 
3. Lifestyle medicine and nutrition 
As part of lifestyle, nutrition is one of the most important key factors 
in lifestyle habits and practices influencing every chronic NCD disease 
[32,33]. 
Since 1975 obesity almost tripled, and in 2016 (34). In 2020 
approximately 39 million children under five were overweight or obese, 
creating a significant public health question since obesity is one of the 
main risk factors for chronic NCD diseases [34]. On the other hand, 
changing dietary habits with increased physical activity helps prevent 
and treat obesity [35]. Furthermore, some studies demonstrated that a 
weight decrease of about 10% could increase life expectancy by pre­
venting NCD [36,37]. 
Dietary patterns have changed over time and are a significant factor 
in the global burden of disease and death [38]. In 2017, a systematic 
analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study evaluating the con­
sumption of significant foods and nutrients concluded that 11 million 
deaths and 255 (Disability-Adjusted-life-years DALYs) were attributable 
to dietary risk factors [33]. Diets low in whole grains are, in general, the 
most 
significant 
dietary 
risk 
factor 
for 
deaths 
and 
Disability-Adjusted-life-years (DALYs). Other dietary risk factors are 
diets low in fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds and diets high in sodium 
[33]. Notwithstanding, the current food production is not aligned with 
planetary health [38]. These facts also highlight the need for in­
terventions to improve not only human but also planetary well-being 
[38]. 
Several interventional studies have addressed the impact of diet 
modifications on clinical outcomes. A summary of the key interventional 
studies is included in Table 2 [39–55]. From the different studies, with 
different study designs, we can conclude that, although some of them 
showed a positive impact of diet modifications on the reported out­
comes, further and robust studies are needed to support the actual 
impact of nutrition in the development and management of chronic 
diseases. 
Nevertheless, various organizations’ 
dietary guidelines and 
consensus statements have recognized the crucial role of nutrition in the 
prevention and treatment of chronic diseases [56–60]. Consensus 
statements and recommendations recommend a dietary pattern higher 
in fruits and vegetables, whole grains, nonfat dairy, seafood, legumes, 
and nuts [56–60]. Guidelines also recommend that those who consume 
alcohol (among adults) do so in moderation. The recommendations also 
reinforce the need for diets that are lower in red and processed meats, 
refined grains, sugar-sweetened foods, and saturated and trans fats, 
emphasizing the importance of adequate caloric intake and also regular 
physical activity as strategies for maintaining a healthy weight and, 
thereby, further reducing the risk of chronic diseases [1,29]. Moreover, 
World Health Organization provides publications to promote and sup­
port healthy lifestyles based on “12 steps to healthy eating” recom­
mendations [61]. Included in these foods are vitamins and minerals, 
which are also vital to boost immunity and healthy development. 
An important point to address is the age-related effect of nutrition, 
namely in disability, since older adults are a growing age group in 
Europe. High-protein intake was associated with better disability tra­
jectories [62]. In this context, results from the MIND diet were reported, 
in a cohort study, as reducing in 53% the risk for developing Alzheimer’s 
disease [63] and a slower decline in cognitive function. The highest 
adherence rates to the MIND diet were associated with a cognitive 
function equivalent to being 7.5 years younger [64], and even modest 
adherence to this diet was associated with a 35% risk reduction for 
Alzheimer’s disease versus the lowest adherence group. High adherence 
to the Mediterranean and DASH diets showed a statistically significant 
benefit [63] and reduced the risk for cognitive decline [65]. However, 
there is a need to develop different strategies allowing healthy aging. 
3.1. Nutrients and foods versus dietary patterns 
The link between dietary patterns, foods, and nutrients is inexorable 
[66]. Dietary guidance over the past decades has moved from specific

foods and nutrients to a greater emphasis on dietary patterns and the 
critical aspect of providing practical advice for implementing recom­
mendations [33]. Nevertheless, dietary patterns are easily used in di­
etary advice since people eat foods and not nutrients. Further 
nutrient-based research will explain the mechanisms by which specific 
foods and dietary patterns act [66]. 
Different educational documents, named Food-based dietary guide­
lines (FBDGs), are regularly updated, providing scientific information on 
the general population’s food composition and nutritional needs [67]. 
National scientific and international organizations publish these guide­
lines. A concise, descriptive global review of this content was recently 
published, aiming to assess the similarities and critical differences of 
diets across the countries [68]. Most countries have developed a graphic 
representation of Food-Based Dietary Guidelines (FBDGs) to illustrate 
the proportions of different foods with similar characteristics that should 
be included in a balanced diet, although they may have a list of messages 
or tips as well [67]. Besides the differences among countries, there are 
similar key points: consume many fruits, vegetables, and cereals, 
limiting fat, simple sugars, and salt [67–69]. 
In Europe, FBDGs have been developed in several countries, being 
the food pyramid used as a food guide illustration in 23 countries out of 
34 and classify foods into five or six groups [69]. This showed that the 
most popular graphic representation of FBDGs is the pyramid. Foods are 
classified into five or six groups. The main food groups are grains, 
vegetables, fruits, and vegetables and fruits together. Most nutritional 
key points are similar among the different European FBDGs, although 
there are some differences in geographic conditions and cultural heri­
tage. Some differences include the modality of food classification. The 
main message is always to consume adequate amounts of grains, vege­
tables, and fruits with a moderate intake of fats, sugars, meats, caloric 
beverages, and salt. Other healthy behaviors are frequently indicated 
[69]. However, FBDGs still seem insufficient regarding ethnic pecu­
liarities, agreement on how to group foods, and subgroup population 
nutritional requirements [69].

Humanity since 2013. It is one of the top 8 most popular diets globally, 
and it incorporates the traditional healthy living habits of people from 
countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea. Three different regions can 
easily be identified for the Mediterranean diet, southern Europe 
(Portugal, Spain, France, and Italy), eastern Mediterranean (Greece, 
Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, and Egypt), and North Africa (Libya, 
Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco). They all use olive oil as the primary 
source of fat and have some mandatory characteristics: Colour, Flavour, 
Taste, Variety, and Mixture, although they can have slightly different 
details which have to do with climate, culture, and geography. The basic 
principles and the components of the diet are the same, low saturated 
fatty acids, high amounts of antioxidants, carbohydrates, and fiber, and, 
above all, high content of monounsaturated fatty acids and n-3 PUFAs, 
mainly derived from olive oil, as alpha-linolenic acid and long-chain 
PUFAs from fish, particularly in certain areas, closer to the sea [70]. 
Mediterranean diet comprises dietary and lifestyle, sociocultural, envi­
ronmental, and health issues [70]. From the diet point of view, the 
Mediterranean diet comprises 
Ancel Keys was the first to draw attention to the reduction in car­
diovascular disease risk among populations whose nutritional model 
was consistent with practices of peoples from the Mediterranean areas 
[71]. After that, research revealed the Mediterranean diet’s beneficial 
effects on NCDs, glycemic control, and cognitive function [70,72–74]. 
The most known symbol of the Mediterranean diet pattern is olive 
oil, used as the primary source of fat. The health benefits attributed to 
olive oil are related to extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) intake with its high 
nutritional quality and multiple positive effects on health. Different 
clinical trials and observational studies showed that consumption of 
olive oil associated with the Mediterranean diet improves cardiovascu­
lar risk, is inversely associated with death with cardiovascular disease 
and all-cause death [72,75–79]. A study performed in the United States, 
outside of the Mediterranean diet, involving 61,181 women and 31,797 
men demonstrated that with a follow-up of 24 years, the higher olive oil 
was associated with a low risk of cardiovascular disease and coronary 
heart disease [80]. One of the essential components of EVOO is phenolic 
compounds responsible for improving antioxidant capacity [81,82]. 
The reduction of cardiovascular risk is accompanied by a significant 
reduction of systemic vascular inflammation markers (IL-6, IL-7, IL- 
aa18, and hs-CRP) [80,83]. Long- and short-term studies demonstrated 
that olive oil supplementation was also associated with a significant 
decrease in inflammatory markers like Thromboxane-B2 (TXB2) and 
Leukotriene-B4, confirming its anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory 
effects [81]. Moreover, studies on subjects at high cardiovascular risk 
showed that after EVOO supplementation, the blood pressure values, 
both systolic and diastolic, decreased [75,84]. 
Fresh fruits and vegetables are vital sources of phytochemicals, 
polyphenols, phytosterols, and carotenoids, bioactive compounds 
believed to confer many health benefits associated with fruit and 
vegetable consumption [85]. For example, the lower mortality risk 
associated with fruit and vegetables is plateaued at approximately 5 
servings of fruit and vegetables per day [86]. In addition, they have 
antioxidative properties and a role in regulating nuclear transcription 
factors, fat metabolism, and inflammatory mediators [87]. 
The main benefits and limitations of a Mediterranean diet are syn­
thesized in Fig. 1 [88–95]. Although the benefits of the Mediterranean 
diet seemed to be well established, the limitations are more controver­
sial. For example, the intake of vitamin D is low, nevertheless, in Med­
iterranean countries, vitamin D is synthesized for several months of 
years, and therefore the oral intake could not be so important [94]. 
Concerning iron deficiency, although red meat intake is low in the 
Mediterranean diet, a study showed that one year in the Mediterranean 
Diet did not result in a lower iron status [95]. Thus, further studies are 
needed to address the fundamental limitations associated with Medi­
terranean Diet. 
In this context, the concept of the French paradox was introduced in 
1992 when it was noticed that French people have low incidence of 
coronary heart disease, even though their diet was rich in saturated fats 
[96]. Wine consumption is the potential explanation for that fact, and at 
that time, it was associated with the wine´s micro-constituents antioxi­
dant capacity [97]. However, it is accepted that besides the antioxidant 
properties, these compounds also exert an anti-inflammatory and 
anti-thrombotic action [98]. Thus, as part of the Mediterranean diet, 
wine contributes to its cardio-protective effect [98]. 
Few studies have compared the Mediterranean diet and other diets 
[94,99,100]. Canada´s food guide and Mediterranean diet have similar­
ities concerning promoting a diet rich in grains, fruits, and vegetables; 
however they differ regarding red wine, fat, meat, and meat alternatives. 
For Canadians, the Mediterranean diet was only preferable if sources of 
vitamin D are included and limited in wine consumption [94]. 
Compared with the Nordic Diet, which differs from the Mediterranean 
diet about the primary source of fat, study results are discrepant, and 
further studies should be developed [100]. However, a review of the 
published studies showed an association between both dies and lower 
risks of chronic disease, disability, and mortality [99]. Furthermore, in

the Nordic population, adherence to a Healthy Nordic diet may be 
protective against disability in the Nordic population [100]. 
Finally, the Mediterranean diet was considered healthy and sus­
tainable, sharing sociocultural benefits [101]. 
3.3. Nutrition and the immune system 
During our whole life, there are diverse exposures to an endless 
amount of nutritional and other stressors like processed food, over­
feeding, environmental toxins, infectious agents, or drugs which can 
promote chronic inflammation and the development of metabolic dis­
orders [102]. 
Moreover, high intake of fat and energy-dense, processed foods, low 
intake of fibers, fruits, and vegetables changed nutritional patterns in 
Western societies and triggered the rise of NCDs. This proinflammatory 
diet is associated with a rising prevalence of asthma, allergies, and 
autoimmune diseases involving inflammatory mechanisms [103–105]. 
On the other hand, healthy diets with fiber, vitamins, and minerals in 
fresh foods act as anti-inflammatory factors [103,104]. 
Fiber is part of a healthy diet and is very important as it generates 
short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and promotes the proliferation of 
commensal bacteria, protecting the gut epithelium. Short-chain fatty 
acids (SCFAs) have anti-inflammatory effects helping epithelial mucus 
secretion, increasing the protective effect on the intestinal surface, and 
preserving the barrier function [106,107] (Fig. 2). The impairment of 
gut microbiota is a significant causal factor for the development of 
inflammation, mainly influenced by lifestyle [102,108]. Gut dysbiosis 
was found in several inflammatory pathologies such as obesity, diabetes, 
cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. This can be connected 
to the induction of chronic low-grade inflammation since the gut 
microbiome is closely connected to innate immune responses 
[109–111]. Vitamins like A, B6, B12, folate, C, D, and E [112–116] and 
some minerals, mainly zinc, copper, selenium, and iron [117,118], are 
fundamental for supporting the human immune system and reducing the 
risk of infections or its complications. Amino acids and fatty acids are 
also essential, of course. 
Essential fatty acids (EFAs) are critical immune regulators. The n-6 
polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), linoleic acid (LA), is converted in the 
mammalian body into arachidonic acid (AA) and subsequently may give 
origin to proinflammatory lipid mediators (eicosanoids). On the con­
trary, from -linolenic acid (ALA), both n-3 PUFA eicosapentaenoic acid 
(EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are produced and subsequently 
converted into anti-inflammatory and/or pro-resolving lipid mediators 
(resolvins and protectins) [119]. Therefore, for the maximum 
anti-inflammatory effect, it is essential to increase n-3 PUFA rather than 
n-6 PUFA. So, the best recommendation for the ratio n-6: n-3 is “the 
lower, the better,” at least 2:1 as found in the Mediterranean diet. Un­
fortunately, in Western countries, this ratio can reach 15:1 for some 
types of diet [120] (Fig. 2). 
Concerning immunomodulation and anti-inflammatory properties, 
olive oil and the Mediterranean diet pattern itself are in the front line. 
Populations that consume a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and fibers 
have lower incidences of inflammatory diseases than Western pop­
ulations [72–74,121,122]. Overall, the Mediterranean pattern has direct 
(mono-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), tocopherols, polyphenols) and 
indirect (low saturated fats, well-balanced linoleic/alpha-linolenic acid) 
effects on the immune system and inflammatory responses. Olive oil and 
probably the Mediterranean diet globally have several effects on 
immune-mediated and inflammatory diseases, such as coronary heart 
disease/cardiovascular diseases, obesity, type-2 diabetes, cancer, 
asthma, and allergies [120]. Mediterranean diet also influences gut 
microbiota because of its content in prebiotics foods like those with 
wheat bran, fructooligosaccharides, and galactosacharides, and pro­
biotics like fermented milk [123–126] (Fig. 2). 
Furthermore, in the presence of a pathogenic agent such as virus and 
bacteria, for correct and timely activation of the immune system, the 
Fig. 2. Nutrition and Immune system [102,104,107]. Diet rich in fibres, fruits, and vegetables and with low intake of fat and energy-dense, processed food con­
tributes to gut homeostasis. Moreover, nutrients absorbed are transported from the gut to the blood, where they can influence bone marrow and may cell types 
throughout the body: enhance dendritic cells, immune cells, macrophage phagocytic function, and Tregs balance resulting in the control of lung microbiota and 
efficient mucociliary clearance and inhaled microbes and particles. SCFAs: short-chain fatty acids, such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate.

metabolic rate of immune cells increases requiring energy sources, 
substrates for biosynthesis, and regulatory molecules, which are almost 
all derived from the diet [127–130]. 
4. Recommendations put into practice 
Healthy dietary patterns can be described as those that are rich in 
health-promoting foods, including plant-based foods, fresh fruits and 
vegetables, antioxidants, nuts, sources of omega-3 fatty acids, low in 
saturated fats and trans fats, animal-derived proteins, and added/refined 
sugars [131]. Globally, they are fiber-rich, nutrient-dense, and deficient 
in proinflammatory foods. 
Patterns such as these are naturally occurring in some areas of the 
world and are based on local or regional traditions and access to food 
depending on its sources, as is the case for the traditional Mediterranean 
and Asian diets. Others have been developed or changed according to 
preparation for studies or their results in terms of health outcomes, like, 
for instance, the DASH [132] and the MIND [133] diets, which share 
some common characteristics [131]. 
Diets must be personalized [134], choices should be made depending 
on the individual needs, culture, habits, and beliefs, like dietary 
cholesterol restriction for hypercholesterolemia; gluten-free for grain 
intolerance; fructose restriction for fructose intolerance; lactose re­
striction for lactose intolerance; lutein for risk of macular degeneration; 
carnitine supplementation for poor acyl-carnitine biosynthesis; 
branched-chain amino acid supplementation for individuals with sar­
copenia; ketogenic diets for epilepsy or higher protein diets for later 
stage insulin resistance [135]. 
It is recognized [136] that maintaining healthy body weight and 
preventing abdominal fat accumulation is healthy. So, mainly in this 
field, many people try to modulate their diet to achieve the best and 
quickest results. What about extreme modulation of diet? 
A Mixed Diet seemed to be healthier than any extreme form of diet 
and besides the long-term results are still unknown and very hard to 
keep for a long time. 
An excellent example of a modulated diet is caloric restriction [137], 
which inhibits key nutrient-sensing and inflammatory pathways, pro­
motes proteostasis, genome stability, stress resistance, and stem cell 
function. With caloric restriction, insulin sensitivity increases, and in­
flammatory status is reduced. This must be combined with diet quality 
modifications [138,139] to keep a nutritional balance. 
Fasting is one example of an extreme diet. By definition, fasting is a 
survival mechanism in both animals and humans [140,[141], especially 
in countries where food conservation is complex [142] . In the rest of the 
world, fasting has been employed either due to religious convictions or 
wellness centers. One of the methods used to control severe obesity is the 
“zero-calorie diet.” Nowadays, people follow several types of fasting 
with the primary goal of achieving the “ideal” weight. 
Much research shows the beneficial effects of fasting on health and 
different pathological conditions, but people must be aware of malnu­
trition if the restriction is taken to the extreme. 
5. Conclusion 
Scientific information is growing regarding the impact of lifestyle 
modifications, namely from the nutrition point of view. Different diet 
modification has been studied with demonstrated positive impacts in the 
management of non-communicable chronic diseases. For example, the 
Mediterranean diet was considered one of the healthy diets strongly 
associated with reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases associated 
with the antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties of the main 
components, namely olive oil, fruits, and vegetables. Nevertheless, it is 
essential to highlight that modification must be applied in personalized 
medicine, being environmentally sustainable and more equitable at a 
national scale.
