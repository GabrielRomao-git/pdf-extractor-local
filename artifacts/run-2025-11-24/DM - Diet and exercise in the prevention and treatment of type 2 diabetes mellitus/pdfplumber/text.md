Diet and exercise in the prevention

Abstract | Evidence from observational studies and randomized trials suggests that prediabetes and
type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) can develop in genetically susceptible individuals in parallel with
weight (that is, fat) gain. Accordingly, studies show that weight loss can produce remission of T2DM
in a dose-d ependent manner. A weight loss of ~15 kg, achieved by calorie restriction as part of an
intensive management programme, can lead to remission of T2DM in ~80% of patients with obesity
and T2DM. However, long-t erm weight loss maintenance is challenging. Obesity and T2DM are
associated with diminished glucose uptake in the brain that impairs the satiating effect of dietary
carbohydrate; therefore, carbohydrate restriction might help maintain weight loss and maximize
metabolic benefits. Likewise, increases in physical activity and fitness are an important contributor
to T2DM remission when combined with calorie restriction and weight loss. Preliminary studies
suggest that a precision dietary management approach that uses pretreatment glycaemic status
to stratify patients can help optimize dietary recommendations with respect to carbohydrate, fat
and dietary fibre. This approach might lead to improved weight loss maintenance and glycaemic
control. Future research should focus on better understanding the individual response to dietary
treatment and translating these findings into clinical practice.

thereby increase glucose excretion)44. Different dietary
regimens might have the potential to optimize weight
loss in patients with T2DM such as, for example, ad

dietary fibre45–47. More importantly, however, diets of dif-

regulating glucose homeostasis, even when weight loss
is matched. Therefore, other dietary or lifestyle factors,
not necessarily related to the absolute amount of weight

Fig. 5 | Differences in diet-induced changes in body weight according to baseline fasting plasma glucose
concentrations. In three separate analyses (one for each of the SHOPUS94, MUFOBES97 and DIOGENES99 trials),
differences in changes in body weight from baseline to 6 months were estimated using a linear mixed model, which
included fasting plasma glucose-b y-d iet interactions, as well as age and sex (and low-c alorie diet in MUFOBES and
DIOGENES) as fixed effects and subject-s pecific random effects96. For SHOPUS, weight changes after 6 months on the
New Nordic Diet (NND) or the Average Danish Diet (ADD) in relationship to baseline fasting glucose (part a) were used to
calculate the difference between diets (part b). The slope for the difference between the NND and the ADD was 3.0 kg per
mmol/l (95% CI 1.2 to 4.8 kg per mmol/l, P = 0.001) (ADD 0.6, 95% CI −0.9 to 2.2, P = 0.43; NND −2.4, 95% CI −1.5 to −3.3,
P < 0.001). For MUFOBES, weight changes after an initial period of diet-i nduced weight loss followed by 6 months on the
NND or the ADD in relationship to baseline fasting glucose (part c) were used to calculate the difference between diets
(part d). The slope for the difference between the NND and ADD was 7.3 kg per mmol/l (95% CI 3.2 to 11.4 kg per mmol/l,
P < 0.001) (ADD 4.9, 95% CI 1.8 to 8.1, P = 0.002; NND −2.3, 95% CI −4.9 to 0.2, P = 0.073). For DIOGENES, weight changes
after an initial period of diet-i nduced weight loss followed by 6 months on the lowest glycaemic load (LGL) diet or the
highest glycaemic load (HGL) diet in relationship to baseline fasting glucose (part e) were used to calculate the difference
between diets (part f). The slope for the difference between the LGL diet and the HGL diet was 1.8 kg per mmol/l (95% CI
0.1 to 3.5 kg per mmol/l, P = 0.038) (HGL 1.6, 95% CI 0.2 to 2.9, P = 0.020; LGL −0.2, 95% CI −1.3 to 0.8, P = 0.67).
